# Broiler.VM.Profile.WebAssembly roadmap

**Status:** Proposed component roadmap for the WebAssembly language profile of the Broiler.VM
execution core. [The evidence ledger](roadmap.status.md) is the authority for what has been
accepted; at the time of writing it records **WA-0 through WA-10 as not started**, and it records
that the component has no source tree, no descriptor, no pinned specification revision, and no
evidence bundle. No milestone is complete because its design appears here.

`Broiler.VM.Profile.WebAssembly` is a **language profile**: one artifact format, one decoder, one
validator, one store and instance model, one interpreter, one linker, one set of host imports, and
one conformance harness, compiled into a product by a composition root that names its descriptor
directly. It is not an execution core and owns none of the mechanism the core owns. It references
exactly two core assemblies and nothing else Broiler-owned, and no core milestone waits for it.

This component differs from the other intended first profile in the one way that matters most to a
plan: **it has no seed.** There is no existing Broiler WebAssembly engine to snapshot, no fork to
take, no inherited defect history, and no inherited review debt.
[Section 4](#4-no-seed-what-greenfield-costs-and-what-it-buys) states what that costs as well as
what it buys, because "greenfield" is a description of the starting position and not an argument
that the work is smaller.

Two properties of this document are load-bearing and stated once here. **No figure, total,
conformance result, benchmark, or Native AOT sample from any other component appears anywhere in
it** — including from the core it is built on and from the sibling profile the core names beside
it. Every number this component publishes will be its own, from its own lane, at its own commit.
And **every claim about the core is checked against the shipped core assemblies rather than
against the core's prose.** Where the two disagree, this document records the code and says so;
[section 7](#7-the-artifact-the-decoder-and-one-disagreement-with-the-core) contains one such
disagreement, and it changes this component's first design decision.

### How this roadmap is split

This plan is three files and one ledger. The argument stays whole in this file; the
milestones and the gate material have their own, because they are read one entry at a time
rather than start to finish.

| File | Sections | What it carries |
|---|---|---|
| `roadmap.md` — this file | 1–18, 20 | The argument: what this profile is, what the core gives it and refuses it, how each piece works, and what it will ask of the core. |
| [`roadmap.delivery.md`](roadmap.delivery.md) | 21–22 | The milestones and the order they are delivered in. |
| [`roadmap.gates.md`](roadmap.gates.md) | 19, 23–26 | The measurement rules, the test and evidence matrix, the release gates, the stop conditions, and the references. |
| [`roadmap.status.md`](roadmap.status.md) | — | The evidence ledger. It, and not any file above, is the authority for what has been accepted. |

Two rules keep the split cheap and are not negotiable. **Section numbers are global and do
not change when a section moves**, so every reference written before the split still resolves
and the gates file holding 19 before 23 is intentional rather than an error. And **milestone
identifiers are never written as links**: `WA-0` through `WA-10` are the join key between this
plan and the ledger, and they stay bare.

## 1. Terminology and support claims

The core fixes most of this vocabulary and this roadmap uses it unchanged. The rows below are the
terms this component adds or narrows; where a term is the core's, that is said.

| Term | Meaning in this roadmap |
|---|---|
| **This profile** | `Broiler.VM.Profile.WebAssembly`. One profile ID, one descriptor, one verifier, one executor factory, one payload-kind range. |
| **The core** | The Broiler.VM execution core: its three packable assemblies and the numbered core contract version they carry. Core-owned terms — verified artifact, verified handle, guest-initiated load, artifact-provider capability, external suspension, deployment composition, feature manifest, core contract version, operation-result envelope — keep their core meanings. |
| **The specification** | The W3C WebAssembly core specification at one pinned, dated revision, together with its binary format, validation rules, execution semantics, and the appendices this profile implements against. A specification version name is never a conformance claim. |
| **Feature manifest** | The core's term, with this profile's content: the exact WebAssembly surface accepted by one version of this profile, minted as a `VmFeatureManifestId` under this profile's own ID. **A specification version alone is never a conformance claim**, and neither is a manifest name; a manifest claims only what its own retained oracle run shows. |
| **Manifest increment** | One further feature-manifest identity with a reviewed scope, its own corpus extension, and its own oracle run. An increment is not a milestone and closes none. This profile expects more increments than milestones, because the specification's own feature set is how its surface grows. |
| **The format version** | This profile's own integer, in the core's sense: the shape of the payload the descriptor admits. **It does not track the specification version.** The binary format's own version field has been `1` across every published specification version, so a format version derived from it would never move; the language surface is carried by the feature manifest, which is its correct home. [Section 7](#7-the-artifact-the-decoder-and-one-disagreement-with-the-core) states what the format version does mean. |
| **Decoding** | Turning payload bytes into a structural module. The specification's first phase. In this component it is the first half of one verification, never a separate public step. |
| **Validation** | Type-checking a decoded module, including the single-pass algorithm over structured control flow. The specification's second phase. In this component it is the second half of the same verification. |
| **Linking** | Resolving a module's imports against a store and a host, and allocating its instance. The specification's third phase. In this component it happens at instantiation, and it is the one specification phase that is *not* verification. |
| **The store** | The specification's term for the mutable state holding every allocated instance, memory, table, global, and tag. **Where the store lives relative to a core instance state is the single most consequential open question in this document**, because the core offers exactly one instantiation shape and WebAssembly linking needs several instances to share one store. [Section 11](#11-the-store-instances-and-linking) enumerates the three possible answers, rejects one, and names the milestone that chooses between the other two. |
| **A trap** | The specification's term for a runtime abort. In this component a trap is a typed profile payload behind a profile fault. It is never a process failure, never a CLR exception crossing the core boundary, and never a core outcome category. |
| **DET / FUL** | The specification's *own* profiles: `DET` is its deterministic profile, `FUL` its full one. **This is a word collision with the core's "profile" and it is not resolvable by renaming either.** Wherever this document says *profile* unqualified it means the core's sense; the specification's sense is always written `DET` or `FUL`, or spelled out as "the specification's deterministic profile". [Section 6](#6-feature-manifests-how-the-language-surface-is-admitted) records that this component implements `DET`, and why that is a refinement rather than a subset. |
| **The oracle** | The specification's own conformance test suite, pinned at an immutable revision, run by this component's own harness, whose self-check proves that a failing test comes back as a failure before any shard is scored. |
| **The ratchet** | The first accepted per-assertion-family totals for a manifest. No later run of that manifest may regress against them. |
| **Deployment composition** | The core's term. [Section 16](#16-deployment-compositions-native-aot-and-the-browser-embedding) records that this profile mints exactly one label, and why another profile's three do not transfer to it. |

A release of this profile claims this profile: its accepted feature-manifest set, its accepted
format-version range, the core contract version it is built against, the specification revision it
was measured against, the composition it publishes and runs, and its deterministic exclusions. It
claims no instruction a manifest does not name and no capability a composition does not contain.
An unknown feature, an unsupported manifest, or an out-of-range format version is a deterministic
load failure, never a best-effort partial execution.

### Scope

This profile owns:

- its artifact shape and format-version range, and its feature manifests;
- decoding, structural validation, type and stack validation over structured control flow, and
  every profile-specific resource check, all of it inside the one verification entry point the
  core provides;
- its value, store, instance, frame, label, call, and trap model;
- import resolution and export projection: the explicit linker, its failure taxonomy, and the
  aliasing and lifetime rules for memories, tables, globals, and tags shared across instances;
- its typed normal-result and fault payloads and the projection accessors that expose them
  without adding a case to any core result enum;
- its host imports: their capability IDs, versions, signature IDs, kinds, reentrancy, thread
  affinity, and exception-translation modes, and the mapping from a WebAssembly import to one of
  them;
- its conformance harness, its pinned suite revision, its script-ingestion path, its scope
  manifests, its failure manifest, and its own regression suite for that machinery;
- its own overhead measurements, its own baseline register, and the honest limits on both; and
- its packages, its composition, its support table, and its assurance and human-review records.

The core owns, and this profile never re-implements: profile selection and the immutable catalog;
bounded byte reading, checked arithmetic, section framing, and allocation guards; the
verified-artifact handle, its identity, its leases, and its lifetime; the limit-precedence
algorithm across host ceilings, profile maxima, and artifact requests; the fifteen budget
dimensions and their metering; the lifecycle state machine, thread affinity, reentrancy,
cancellation, and idempotent disposal; guest-initiated-load mediation and its bounds; external
suspension; the profile-neutral operation-result envelopes; and the composition, trimming, and
Native AOT gates for the core boundary.

**One core primitive is in scope only in part, and that is a finding rather than a preference.**
The core's variable-length integer readers accept canonical encodings only; the specification
admits padded ones. [Section 7](#7-the-artifact-the-decoder-and-one-disagreement-with-the-core)
states the consequence, and it is why this profile decodes integers with its own code over the
core's byte primitives instead of calling the core's `TryReadVarUInt32`.

### Non-goals

- **A compiler.** This profile consumes artifacts that external toolchains already produce. There
  is no Broiler WebAssembly compiler, no lowering assembly, and no compiler sibling — the core's
  own roadmap says so — and [section 5](#5-package-boundaries-and-the-dependency-graph) records
  what follows for the assembly graph. The format package that exists to keep a compiler and an
  executor from depending on each other has nothing to separate here, and creating one anyway
  would be an assembly created to shorten a file.
- **The text format, in any product.** The specification's text format exists in this component
  only as a **test-only** ingestion path, because the conformance corpus is distributed as scripts
  written in it. A scan asserts it appears in no product package and in no published closure. Its
  absence from the product is the point; its presence in the harness is unavoidable.
- **A second execution arm.** This profile has one interpreter. It emits no IL, builds no
  expression tree, compiles no delegate, and contains no tiering path into dynamic code. There is
  no bytecode-to-IL promotion, no deoptimization, and no on-stack replacement, because there is no
  second tier for any of them to reach. A product closure containing an IL emitter is a release
  blocker, not a configuration.
- **A second validator.** Whatever validates a module is this profile's validator, reached through
  the core's one verification entry point. A build-time reimplementation that is merely supposed
  to agree with it is a security defect with a schedule attached.
- **Lazy validation.** The specification explicitly permits deferring a function body's validation
  until first invocation, with an invalid body then trapping. This profile declines that
  permission, because invariant 3 forbids a structural check migrating into execution and the
  core's stage matrix makes `InvalidArtifact` illegal at instantiation, invocation, and resume.
  [Section 8](#8-validation) states the consequence, and it is a case where the strictly stricter
  reading is also the cheaper one.
- **A security sandbox claim.** Validation, bounded budgets, and a typed host boundary are
  correctness properties of this profile. They are not an isolation claim for untrusted modules,
  and no conformance total or benchmark result may be presented as one.
- **CLR interop.** No WebAssembly-reachable surface resolves a CLR type by name, constructs a
  generic type at run time, or enumerates CLR members. A host reaches guest code through typed,
  allowlisted, versioned capabilities and through nothing else.
- **WASI, the component model, or any embedding layer above the core specification.** Each is a
  separate specification with its own versioning and its own conformance story; each is
  expressible as host capabilities over this profile rather than inside it; and none is in any
  manifest this roadmap allocates. Naming them as out of scope is not a judgement about their
  value. It is a statement that this component's support table will not imply them.
- **The JavaScript API for WebAssembly.** `WebAssembly.Module`, `Instance`, `Memory`, `Table`, and
  `Global` belong to a *different* specification, and implementing them means crossing two core
  runtimes carrying two profiles.
  [Section 17](#17-the-cross-profile-boundary-the-javascript-api-for-webassembly) works that
  boundary through rather than leaving a browser to discover it, and records it as this
  component's largest unpriced risk.
- **A debug wire protocol.** External suspension is a core lifecycle state; what a paused profile
  exposes is this profile's own surface, and a wire protocol is a separate component if it is ever
  wanted.
- **Filesystem, network, or module-registry ownership.** The host owns identity resolution,
  transport, content policy, and integrity checks. This profile asks; it never fetches.
- **A change to the core.** A WebAssembly requirement that the frozen contract cannot express is
  an amendment proposal or a recorded refusal
  ([section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight)). It is never a
  language-specific path added to the core's execution loop, and never a second core state
  machine.
- **Any performance claim about another engine.** This profile publishes its own overhead against
  its own controls. Fuel figures are not comparable across profiles and are never presented as if
  they were.

## 2. Engineering invariants

1. **Nothing runs that verification did not admit.** Every byte this profile executes came out of
   the core's verification entry point as an immutable, profile-bound handle. There is no second
   route, and at core contract version 1 there could not be one: verification takes a span and
   nothing else.
2. **Verification is total.** The verifier answers; it does not throw. Every rejection is one of
   the five verifier outcomes the core admits, carrying this profile's own diagnostic code and
   position. An exception escaping the verifier is a contract violation, not a rejection.
3. **A structural or type check happens at verification or it does not happen.** No decode, index,
   type, stack-consistency, or block-nesting rule migrates into first execution, and the
   specification's own permission to validate lazily is declined rather than exercised. A late
   check reported as a trap makes a malformed module indistinguishable from a program that
   trapped, and hollows out the corpus that is supposed to prove the boundary.
4. **Decoding and validation are two phases inside one verification, and their order is
   observable.** The specification requires decoding to complete before validation begins, so a
   module that is both malformed and invalid is reported malformed. The conformance suite tests
   exactly that distinction, which makes phase order a correctness property here and not an
   implementation detail.
5. **The executor answers in the core's vocabulary and no other.** Every step is one of the five
   execution-step kinds. Traps, uncaught exceptions, and link errors are typed payloads this
   profile owns; no profile code names a core outcome category, and adding an instruction never
   adds a core result case.
6. **No exception escapes into the core.** Every internal failure is caught at this profile's own
   adapter and converted. An escaped exception is a defect of this component even when the core
   survives it.
7. **Guest-controlled cost is charged proportionally.** An operation whose work grows with its
   input charges fuel as a declared monotone function of that input, at the declared granularity,
   with a retained fixture and an unsimplified control. `memory.copy`, `memory.fill`,
   `memory.init`, `table.copy`, `table.fill`, `table.init`, `array.copy`, `array.fill`, and
   `array.new_data` are each a single instruction with input-proportional work, and a flat charge
   on any of them means a bounded budget bounds nothing.
8. **The verified module is immutable; every instance is not.** The specification draws this line
   itself and the core requires it: everything reachable from a verified state must be immutable
   once verification returns and safe for unsynchronised concurrent readers. Memories, tables,
   globals, and every mutable cache belong to a store, never to a handle. Two runtimes sharing one
   verified handle share nothing mutable.
9. **The language surface grows only in reviewed increments.** Each increment mints one feature
   manifest, extends the retained corpus, and re-runs the oracle against the ratchet. No increment
   is justified by claiming an earlier manifest implies it, and none is justified by the fact that
   the specification happens to bundle its features into one version number.
10. **Unsupported surface is truthful.** Every instruction, type, or capability a manifest excludes
    has a named deterministic failure that the support table publishes. A shape-only stub does not
    satisfy a capability gate, and a specification version is not a language claim.
11. **Native AOT is demonstrated, not inferred.** Analyzer cleanliness and a trimmed build are
    inputs. The claimed composition publishes **and runs** its workload on every declared RID with
    trim and AOT warnings treated as errors, and its published closure is read off the published
    output.
12. **No evidence transfers.** No conformance result, benchmark, measurement, review decision, or
    Native AOT sample produced by any other component — the core included — is this component's
    evidence, and no gate here may cite one. Every claim starts at zero.
13. **The component is provable at every milestone.** Each milestone closes against something a
    reader can re-run: a corpus with recorded expected answers, a publish-and-run log with a
    closure report, a negative control that fails when injected and passes after revert. A gate
    that can only be closed by reading a document is a gate-design defect.
14. **This profile is the core's counterweight and behaves like one.** The core designed its
    contract against two languages and named this one as the check on whether a proposed feature
    is genuinely general or one language's need in disguise.
    [Section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) discharges that duty
    explicitly, and does so without a dependency edge, a citation, or a shared item identifier in
    either direction with any other profile component.

## 3. What the core already gives this profile, and what it refuses

The core is implemented, not paper. This section records what a profile author actually finds
there, so this roadmap plans against code rather than against prose. Nothing in it is a claim that
the core is accepted: every core milestone is in progress and unaccepted, its review record is
unsigned, and [section 21](roadmap.delivery.md#21-milestones) carries that as a dependency rather
than assuming it away.

### The seven types this profile implements

| Type | What this profile owes it |
|---|---|
| `IVmProfileVerifier` | `Verify` over a descriptor, a payload span, a verification context, and a token, returning a `VmVerifierOutcome`. Plus three version integers — the authored core contract version, the built-against core contract version, and this profile's own verifier semantic version — and its profile ID. |
| `IVmProfileExecutor` | `Instantiate`, `Invoke`, and `Resume`, each returning a `VmExecutionStep` and each taking the operation's cancellation token; and `Unwind`, which **returns nothing** and takes a continuation plus one effective unwind allowance the core has already reduced to the tighter of the descriptor's abandon budget and the runtime's unwind budget — no token, no result. Plus its profile ID. One executor instance per runtime, created by the descriptor's factory from an `IVmExecutionEnvironment`. |
| `IVmVerifiedState` | The immutable decoded and validated module a successful verification produces. Opaque to the core; the whole of what execution may read. This is the specification's own module/instance split, and for once the core's requirement and the language's structure agree exactly. |
| `IVmInstanceState` | The mutable state instantiation produces. **Whether one of these is a whole store or one module instance within a runtime-scoped store is the open question of [section 11](#11-the-store-instances-and-linking)**, and it is the only one of the seven types whose meaning this roadmap cannot yet fix. |
| `IVmProfileContinuation` | A captured, resumable suspension. Single-use, runtime-owned. [Section 14](#14-suspension-threads-and-what-this-profile-does-not-declare) records that this profile declares no suspension at its first manifests, and why the type is implemented anyway. |
| `IVmProfilePayload` | Every value crossing back to the caller: returned values, traps, uncaught exceptions, link errors. Carries a `VmPayloadIdentity` whose kind IDs must lie inside the descriptor's declared range. |
| `IVmBoundedAllocationMeter` | The adapter that lets the core's bounded allocator charge this profile's allocations, because the core's own meter type is not public. Writing it is this profile's work, not the core's. |

The five verifier outcomes are `Verified`, `InvalidArtifact`, `ResourceExhaustion`, `Cancellation`,
and `UnsupportedProfile`. The five execution-step kinds are `Completed`, `Instantiated`,
`Suspended`, `Faulted`, and `ContractViolation`. There are no others, and this profile's whole
answer space is those two closed sets.

### The descriptor is a contract, not a registration form

One full-arity construction supplies every row: identity and display name, descriptor revision,
supported format-version range, accepted feature manifests, the verifier instance, the executor
factory, artifact representation kind, artifact lifetime kind, concurrent-verification support,
thread affinity, cancellation poll bound, abandon budget, a fifteen-element default limit vector,
a fifteen-element profile hard-maximum vector, a fifteen-row budget declaration matrix, host
capability imports, the guest-load declaration, the asynchronous-instantiation declaration, the
external-suspension declaration, the payload kind-ID range, the authored and built-against core
contract versions, the conformance manifest identity and version, the diagnostics identity, the
package identity, the fault-recovery mode, the maximum uncharged work, the charging granularity,
and the artifact sharing mode.

The catalog validates it and refuses with a named reason from a closed set — among them
`ProfileIdReservedNamespace`, `FeatureManifestIdOutOfNamespace`,
`BudgetDeclarationMatrixIncomplete`, `VerifierWorkNotApplicable`, `PayloadKindIdRangeInvalid`,
`ProfileDefaultExceedsProfileMaximum`, `GuestLoadDeclarationIncomplete`, `GuestLoadMaximumUnbounded`,
`VerifierWorkToFuelRateInvalid`, `MaxUnchargedWorkInvalid`, and `ChargingGranularityInvalid`. Each
one this profile's descriptor can provoke gets a named negative case; a refusal reported with the
wrong reason is a defect.

Two identity rules bind this component's names before any code exists. A profile ID is two to
eight dot-separated ASCII labels, and the first label `broiler` is reserved and paired with a
Broiler package identity — so `broiler.webassembly` is legitimate for this component and obliges a
`Broiler.*` package ID. A feature manifest ID must begin with its own profile's ID followed by a
dot and at least one further label, which makes `broiler.webassembly.<surface>` the shape of every
manifest this component ever mints. **The spelling of the profile ID is therefore not cosmetic**:
an abbreviation would be inherited by every manifest identity, every diagnostics namespace, and
every support-table row for the life of the component. WA-0 chooses between `broiler.webassembly`
and `broiler.wasm` and records the choice with that consequence stated.

### One structural gift the other intended profile does not get

**The artifact descriptor carries identity beside the bytes, not inside them.** A
`VmArtifactDescriptor` supplies the profile ID, exactly one format version, exactly one feature
manifest ID, the requested limits, and the caller's own identity; the payload span is separate.
Nothing in the contract requires the payload to restate any of it.

The consequence shapes [section 7](#7-the-artifact-the-decoder-and-one-disagreement-with-the-core)
and is worth stating plainly: **a bare `.wasm` file produced by any external toolchain can be the
payload verbatim, with no Broiler wrapper, no re-encoding, and no envelope.** The module's own
magic and version are checked by this profile's decoder as the specification requires, and the
core's identity requirements are satisfied entirely by the descriptor the caller already had to
construct. A browser that fetched a module hands those exact bytes to verification.

### The fifteen budget dimensions, and what this profile intends to declare

`Fuel`, `WallClock`, `AllocatedBytes`, `LiveBytes`, `HostCalls`, `CallDepth`, `VerifierWork`,
`ArtifactBytes`, `SectionCount`, `DeclaredCount`, `StructuralDepth`, `NestedLoadDepth`,
`NestedLoadFanOut`, `NestedLoadBytes`, `LiveRuntimes`. The declaration matrix has no default row: a
dimension this profile does not charge says `NotApplicable`, the catalog refuses an incomplete
matrix, and it refuses `VerifierWork` declared inapplicable outright, because verification always
does work.

The intended matrix, which WA-1 fixes and later milestones may correct with a dated record but may
not drift:

| Dimension | Intended | What charges it |
|---|---|---|
| `Fuel` | Charged | Every instruction dispatched, plus the proportional families of invariant 7. |
| `WallClock` | Charged | Core-metered against the operation; this profile polls often enough for it to bite. |
| `AllocatedBytes` | Charged | Decode-time buffers; instance allocation; every `memory.grow` and `table.grow`. |
| `LiveBytes` | Charged | Linear memories and tables are the dominant retained cost of a WebAssembly instance, and a profile that did not report them would let a store grow without any ceiling noticing. Reported on growth, released on instance disposal. |
| `HostCalls` | Charged | Every call into an imported host function. |
| `CallDepth` | Charged | Every activation frame. [Section 12](#12-traps-exhaustion-and-why-neither-is-a-process-failure) records that the default is measured, not chosen. |
| `VerifierWork` | Charged | Required by the catalog. Decode and validation work. |
| `ArtifactBytes` | Charged | Enforced by the core's reader over the payload. |
| `SectionCount` | Charged | WebAssembly sections are literal, so this dimension has a direct referent for once. Custom sections count. |
| `DeclaredCount` | Charged | Every vector length in the binary format — types, functions, locals, elements, data, fields, and the rest. |
| `StructuralDepth` | Charged | Section framing and block nesting, as a *high-water mark* rather than a running total — **which the core already supports and an earlier draft of this row said it did not.** The relevant members are not `TryCharge` alone: the metering surface is four members, and the retain/release pair exists precisely for the eight ceiling-class dimensions, of which this is one. Only a ceiling-class dimension releases; an allowance never refunds. So the discipline is charge on entry, release on exit, and the refusal lands exactly at the ceiling on a long function of many sequential shallow blocks — the failure mode the earlier draft feared is the one the pair prevents. This profile already applies the same discipline to `LiveBytes`, which is declared in this same table as reported on growth and released on disposal — so the earlier reading was internally inconsistent as well as wrong. Section framing is core-metered through the reader in any case. **WA-1 records the charge sites and the one caution below, not the question.** |
| `NestedLoadDepth` | NotApplicable, **default a large finite value** | No guest-initiated loads at any manifest this roadmap allocates. The maximum may be whatever this profile likes - it binds this profile's artifacts alone. **The default is the half that reaches a neighbour**, and getting it wrong is a cross-profile defect: see below. |
| `NestedLoadFanOut` | NotApplicable, **default a large finite value** | As above. |
| `NestedLoadBytes` | NotApplicable, **default a large finite value** | As above. |
| `LiveRuntimes` | Charged | Core-metered; this profile adds nothing. |

**One caution the metering surface carries, and it lands on this profile harder than on any
other.** The retention report returns nothing, so a refusal on a ceiling-class dimension cannot be
handed back at the point of retention: it is latched, and the operation observes it at its next
charge or poll. **A ceiling-class dimension therefore cannot carry a guest-observable refusal.**
[Section 12](#12-traps-exhaustion-and-why-neither-is-a-process-failure) requires a refused
`memory.grow` to be guest-observable and non-terminating — the module decides what to do and the
operation continues — and the obvious route to that, admitting or refusing growth on a `TryCharge`
of `AllocatedBytes` with `LiveBytes` reported for accounting only, **does not work against the
shipped core, which this roadmap checked rather than assumed.** A refused `TryCharge` at any scope
latches exhaustion on the meter, and the core then rewrites the completed step as
`ResourceExhaustion` regardless of what the profile did with the `false` it was handed. So a
charge cannot be used as a refusable, guest-observable check: **there is no spelling of a
guest-observable `memory.grow` refusal on the shipped contract at all.** The same latch makes the
aggregate `LiveBytes` case worse rather than better, since the guest has already observed a
*successful* grow before the operation aborts — which is precisely the outcome
[section 12](#12-traps-exhaustion-and-why-neither-is-a-process-failure) forbids. **WA-5 cannot
choose a memory representation until this is resolved, and the resolution is an amendment rather
than a local workaround**, which is why
[section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) carries it as a blocking
ask rather than a filed one: a refusable retention member would be general to any profile with
host-visible retained state, which is the counterweight test this profile applies to everyone
else's asks.

**A maximum is a statement about this profile; a default is a statement about its neighbours.** A
profile hard maximum is **not** a statement of what this profile uses; the defaults are that. The
maximum is the most this profile would tolerate a host granting, and it binds **this profile's own
modules and nobody else's** — verification intersects the host's ceiling with the maxima of the
profile the artifact names, and with no other profile's.

**The default is the declaration that reaches other profiles.** A host that adopts profile
defaults rather than stating numbers gets the *tightest default in the catalog*, per dimension,
because at runtime creation no profile has been selected and there is no other safe answer. That
matters more here than anywhere else, because the composition this component exists to serve is a
browser that will also carry a JavaScript profile.
[Section 17](#17-the-cross-profile-boundary-the-javascript-api-for-webassembly) carries it as a
named risk with a named owner.

**The sharpest case is the one this profile would get wrong by instinct, and it is about defaults.**
A dimension declared `NotApplicable` in the budget matrix is a statement about what this profile
*charges*. It is not a statement about the limit vectors, which are separate, and the default
resolution reads every descriptor in the catalog with no exemption for the inapplicable ones. So
writing `0` into the three guest-load **defaults** — the natural thing to write for "I do not use
this" — **hands a host that adopts defaults a ceiling of zero nested loads, and makes `eval` fail in
a JavaScript profile beside this one with a resource exhaustion naming a dimension this profile never
touches, in a verifier that has done nothing wrong.** What keeps a dimension unreachable is an import
list and a budget matrix, **not a zero ceiling**.

**`Unconstrained` is not available for a default, and the code says so before the prose did.**
`VmDescriptorValidation` refuses any descriptor whose `LimitDefaults` carries an unconstrained slot,
with reason `LimitDefaultsInvalid`, and the comment beside it gives the reason: a default meaning
unbounded would make adopting the profile default identical to declaring no ceiling at all, which
the core's invariant 9 forbids because omission never means unbounded. A profile's hard **maxima**
may use `Unconstrained`; its **defaults** may not. So the natural writing of "I do not constrain
this" is refused at catalog construction exactly as `0` is a cross-profile hazard, and the three
guest-load defaults have no costless spelling. **WA-0 publishes these three defaults as a large
finite value, stated as a number, with the reason recorded** — and records what the number does not
buy: a finite default still participates in the catalog-wide tightest-default fold, so a host that
adopts defaults still gets the tightest of them, and the cross-profile hazard is bounded rather than
removed. Naming the residue is the point; a default that looked free would hide it.

*Corrected 2026-08-31.* Until then the same paragraph said all of this about the **maxima**, because
the core also clamped every runtime ceiling to the tightest maximum in the catalog. That clamp was a
defect against the core's own record, which always placed a profile maximum at verification against
the selected profile, and it has been removed. This profile's maxima are now its own business; the
obligation moved one column across to the defaults, which is a smaller exposure — a host that states
explicit ceilings never meets it at all — but not an absent one.

### What the core refuses to do for this profile

- It stores no values, inspects no frames, and knows no opcode. There is no shared value ABI to
  reach for and none is coming.
- It discovers nothing. No assembly load, no type lookup by name, no scan, no activator, no
  module-initializer ordering. A composition root names this profile's descriptor directly or the
  profile is not in the image.
- **It provides no argument channel.** An invocation request carries one UTF-8 entry-point name
  and nothing else. For a profile that compiles whole programs that is an inconvenience. For this
  one it is the central gap, because a WebAssembly module is *nothing but* exported entities with
  typed signatures, and the conformance suite is built end to end on invoking exported functions
  with arguments. [Section 10](#10-execution-mapping-webassembly-onto-the-core-lifecycle) works it
  through, WA-1 picks an answer, and
  [section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) records what would have
  to be true for it to become an amendment.
- **It does provide a result channel.** A typed profile payload with projection accessors carries
  returned values back without adding a core result case, and it can carry several, so multi-value
  returns from an exported function are expressible today. The asymmetry between arguments and
  results is real, and it is the shape of the whole problem.
- It gives an executing profile no way to instantiate a further module through the core. This
  profile declares no guest-initiated loads, so the mediator is not on its path at all — but the
  refusal still binds, and [section 11](#11-the-store-instances-and-linking) records what it means
  for a store that must hold several linked modules.
- It offers no persisted envelope. Bounded outer-envelope parsing is admitted by the contract and
  implemented by no core milestone, so [section 18](#18-persistence-and-the-code-cache) plans a
  code cache that does not exist yet and gates it accordingly.
- **It admits exactly one verification input form, and that is settled rather than open.** The
  byte round trip is mandatory and verification is whole-artifact and eager, so a handle means the
  whole module was decoded and validated. Each is reopened only by a numbered amendment. For this
  profile the round trip costs nothing — the bytes came from outside anyway — and the eager
  reading is the one invariant 3 already required.
  [Section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) records that this
  profile is therefore the counterweight that would *decline* both amendments rather than fund
  them.
- **Its variable-length integer readers accept canonical encodings only.** The core's own package
  description says "canonical LEB128", and the reader's source says over-long encodings are
  rejected "rather than accepted and truncated". The specification says the opposite.
  [Section 7](#7-the-artifact-the-decoder-and-one-disagreement-with-the-core) is the whole
  treatment, and it is the first design decision this component has to take.
- It will not learn this profile's semantics. A requirement that cannot be expressed through the
  profile-facing checklist is an amendment or a refusal, never a special case.

## 4. No seed: what greenfield costs, and what it buys

The core roadmap fixes seeding conditions on the *other* intended first profile. It fixes none on
this one, because there is nothing to seed from: no Broiler component implements WebAssembly
execution, and the one assembly in the wider repository whose name contains the word is a browser
rendering back end that emits canvas calls and decodes nothing. **This component starts empty.**

A roadmap that left it at that would be hiding the interesting half. "No seed" is not a smaller
plan; it is a differently shaped one, and both directions are worth stating before the first
commit.

### 4.1 What it buys

- **No fork to police.** There is no snapshot identity to record recursively, no two-way boundary
  rule to enforce against a legacy component, no waited-on set, no snapshot stop condition, and no
  risk of a fix leaking across a fork. WA-0 is correspondingly smaller than it would otherwise be,
  and the architecture rule register loses a whole family of edges.
- **No inherited defect history and no inherited review debt.** Every unit in this component is
  written here, so the assurance system starts with an origin distribution of exactly one kind and
  the review queue grows only as fast as the work does. Nothing arrives unreviewed on day one
  because nothing arrives.
- **No amputation.** There is no dynamic-metaobject interface on a value base type to remove, no
  module-initializer bootstrap to delete, no reflective static constructor in the lowest layer of
  the graph, and no transitive project reference into an IL emitter to break. The Native AOT
  position is clean by construction rather than by surgery, and WA-0's gate can ask for a clean
  closure from the first compile instead of after an ingest.
- **No value-representation inheritance.** The value model is designed against the specification
  rather than negotiated against a body of existing library code that is already typed against
  something else. The specification's value set is small, closed, and fully specified.
- **The specification is the design.** Decoding, validation, and execution each have a normative
  description with a reference implementation and a conformance suite. There is no equivalent of
  reconstructing intent from a codebase.

### 4.2 What it costs

- **Everything is a first draft.** A copied parser has been run against real input for years. This
  profile's decoder will not have been run against anything until it is written, so the corpus and
  the fuzz targets are load-bearing earlier here than they would be for a fork, and WA-2 puts them
  before the interpreter rather than after it.
- **The surface is large, and its size is set by someone else.** The specification's current
  version standardises a large group of features at once, among them garbage collection, a typed
  reference system with subtyping and recursive type groups, exception handling, tail calls, a
  64-bit address space, multiple memories, and a 128-bit vector instruction family that is by
  itself comparable in size to the original instruction set. **This roadmap does not restate the
  counts**; [section 26](roadmap.gates.md#26-specification-and-platform-references) pins the
  specification revision and the counts are read off its own index of instructions and index of
  types at that revision. What matters here is the consequence: the first manifest cannot be "the
  specification", and [section 6](#6-feature-manifests-how-the-language-surface-is-admitted)
  allocates manifests so that a release can be truthful long before the surface is complete.
- **The type system is the expensive part, and it is not obvious from the instruction list.**
  Typed references, subtyping, recursive type groups, and structural type canonicalization are a
  validation-time cost that a reader who has only seen the numeric core will underestimate. The
  suite has files devoted to type canonicalization and type equivalence for exactly that reason.
  [Section 6](#6-feature-manifests-how-the-language-surface-is-admitted) keeps that surface behind
  its own manifest and [section 8](#8-validation) keeps it out of the first validator.
- **Conformance is unusually unforgiving, in a way that is a gift after the first month and a
  tax before it.** The suite is exhaustive, external, and adversarial; it grades decoding,
  validation, linking, trapping, and execution separately; and it will not accept a partial
  implementation quietly. There is no gentle on-ramp, which is why WA-4 builds the harness before
  the interpreter exists rather than after.
- **A greenfield component still has an assurance floor to build.** The annotation grammar, the
  generated review report, the fingerprint binding, the release-mode gate, the evidence-bundle
  contract, and the collection script are this component's own code and are not smaller for the
  tree being empty. WA-0 is that work and nothing else.

### 4.3 What is acquired rather than written

| Material | Disposition |
|---|---|
| The core's three packable assemblies | **Referenced as packages**, exactly two of them by the profile: the abstractions and the binary primitives. Never vendored, never copied, never sourced from a project reference across component boundaries. |
| The specification document | **Pinned by dated revision, retrieved, hashed, and archived.** Retrieving and archiving a third-party document is a *human* action; until someone performs it, the pin is provisional and carries a named exclusion in the ledger. WA-0 records the intended revision; WA-2 records the one actually taken. |
| The conformance test suite | **Pinned by immutable commit** and ingested by a **test-only** path. It is Apache-2.0 licensed material entering this repository, so [section 4.4](#44-licence-attribution-and-one-notice-that-must-change) applies to it. No file of it is referenced by a product project, and a scan asserts it appears in no published closure. |
| A text-format reader for the suite's scripts | **Written here, test-only.** The suite is distributed as scripts in the specification's text format, so something must read them. It is this component's code, it lives in the harness, and it is subject to the same no-product-reference rule as the corpus it reads. It is not a WebAssembly text-format implementation and does not claim to be one: it reads what the suite actually contains. |
| A binary encoder | **Written here, test-only.** The malformed corpus is generated, and generating a malformed module means being able to emit a well-formed one first. It exists to produce corpus entries and nothing else, and a scan asserts it is in no product closure. Its absence from the product is what keeps "no compiler" true. |
| Everything else | **Written here.** Decoder, validator, store, linker, interpreter, payloads, descriptor, host adapter, harness, corpus, fuzz targets, measurement lane. |

### 4.4 Licence, attribution, and one notice that must change

The conformance suite and the reference material are Apache-2.0, and ingesting them means carrying
the obligations of that licence: retain the notices, mark modified files as changed, and carry the
NOTICE content forward. This component's own licence and notice file satisfy that on its own terms.

One consequence reaches outside this component and must not be discovered at release time: **the
core component's third-party notice currently asserts that nothing it ships is vendored or
copied.** That assertion is scoped to the core's own packages and stays true — but only if it stays
scoped, and this component is about to place a large body of third-party test material in the same
repository tree. WA-0 carries an explicit item to confirm the scoping or to amend the notice, with
the release owner co-signing. An attribution obligation discovered during a publish is a stop.

A second consequence is smaller and easier to get wrong: **the suite is test material, and a
support table must never present a suite file as this component's own evidence of anything except
a run.** The corpus is inputs; the retained run is the evidence.
[Section 15](#15-the-conformance-oracle) states the difference where it can be enforced.

---

## 5. Package boundaries and the dependency graph

These names follow the pattern the core fixes for a profile and are hypotheses until WA-0 proves
the graph with project shells and an explicit assembly budget. No assembly is created to shorten a
file; each must enforce a dependency, AOT, deployment, ownership, test, or package boundary.

**The pivot argument does not transfer, and this is the section where that shows.** The core's
placement rule for a profile puts the format in its own assembly because a compiler and an
executor must agree on the bytecode and neither may depend on the other. This profile has no
compiler. Its format is the W3C binary format, its only encoder is test-only, and its only decoder
is inside the verifier. There is therefore nothing for a format assembly to hold apart, and
creating one would be creating an assembly to shorten a file. **The default here is one product
assembly**, and a split needs a justification that names the boundary it enforces.

| Logical boundary | Candidate assembly | Responsibility and dependency rule |
|---|---|---|
| Profile | `Broiler.VM.Profile.WebAssembly` | Descriptor, decoder, validator, verified module, store and instance model, linker, interpreter, host imports, payload projections. References exactly the two core assemblies and nothing else Broiler-owned. |
| Composition root | `Broiler.VM.Profile.WebAssembly.Composition.Execution` | The one named deployment composition. The only project that knows which profiles and capabilities an image contains. Non-packable unless the composition register advertises it. |
| Test-only | conformance host, script reader, corpus store and encoder, fuzz host, soak host, bench host | Never referenced by a product project and never present in a published closure. |

```text
Broiler.VM.Abstractions              ──→ (nothing)
Broiler.VM.Binary                    ──→ (nothing)
…Profile.WebAssembly                 ──→ Abstractions + Binary
composition root                     ──→ Broiler.VM.Runtime + the profile
conformance / corpus / fuzz hosts    ──→ the profile  (never referenced by any product project)
```

The rules the verified graph must retain, whatever the names become:

- the profile's Broiler.VM reference set is **exactly** the two core assemblies — no reference to
  the core runtime, no package reference to a third core package, no `InternalsVisibleTo` in
  either direction;
- **no edge in either direction reaches any other Broiler profile component**, asserted by an
  architecture rule with a passing witness and a negative control, including the inbound half. Two
  profiles in one browser image are composed by a composition root; they are not linked to each
  other, and [section 17](#17-the-cross-profile-boundary-the-javascript-api-for-webassembly)
  depends on that staying true;
- no product project references a test project, a fixture, a corpus, or a conformance host, and no
  product project references the text-format reader or the binary encoder;
- every namespace matches its assembly;
- there is no aggregate profile-listing type anywhere. One would reference every profile assembly
  and defeat the exact-closure reports the composition depends on; and
- **a second product assembly is a dated decision, not a convenience.** If the vector instruction
  family or the garbage-collected type surface turns out to justify its own assembly on trimming
  grounds — an execution-only image that carries no vector interpreter is a real product — that is
  a decision with a measured closure difference attached, taken at the milestone that mints the
  manifest and not before.

---

## 6. Feature manifests: how the language surface is admitted

The core fixes a manifest's shape and identity; this profile fixes its content. Three rules make
that a gate rather than a label.

**One manifest, one reviewed scope, one oracle run.** A manifest is minted with an explicit list of
what it admits, an extension to the retained malformed corpus, and its own conformance run from an
exact commit against the pinned suite revision. A manifest with no retained run of its own is not
accepted, and the support table says so.

**Increments do not inherit, and a specification version is not an increment.** Manifest *n+1*
admits what its own scope names. It may not be justified by arguing that manifest *n* implies it,
and it may not be justified by the specification bundling several features under one version
number. The specification's versions are a publication convenience; this profile's manifests are
claims backed by runs.

**A manifest is refused, not degraded.** A module whose descriptor names a manifest this descriptor
does not accept is `InvalidArtifact` with reason `UnsupportedFeatureManifest`. There is no partial
acceptance and no fallback to a smaller manifest, and in particular **a module that decodes but
uses an instruction outside its declared manifest is rejected at validation** rather than trapping
at first execution.

### This profile implements the specification's deterministic profile

The specification defines its own profiles, and this component implements `DET`.

The reasoning is not about performance. `DET` fixes the two places the language is deliberately
underspecified: NaN payload propagation from floating-point instructions, and the behaviour of the
relaxed vector instructions. Both are places where `FUL` admits several answers.

- **A component whose whole method is retained corpora with recorded expected answers cannot hold
  a corpus whose expected answers legitimately vary.** A malformed-corpus entry compares an
  observed triple against a recorded one, byte for byte, across three publish modes. An
  execution corpus over `FUL` relaxed instructions would have no such triple to record.
- **`DET` is a refinement, not a subset.** Every behaviour `DET` fixes is one of the behaviours
  `FUL` already admits, so a `DET` implementation is a conforming `FUL` implementation. The
  conformance suite's own result patterns accommodate this: a canonical-NaN pattern and an
  arithmetic-NaN pattern are matched by a deterministic implementation, and the alternation
  pattern the suite uses for relaxed instructions is satisfied by any one of its arms.
- **It makes the relaxed vector surface scoreable at all.** Under `FUL` a relaxed instruction has
  no single right answer to assert; under `DET` it has one. That is what moves it from
  "excluded, because untestable here" to "implementable behind its own manifest".

Two consequences must be published rather than assumed. The support table names `DET` explicitly,
because a consumer choosing between engines on relaxed-vector throughput is choosing between
different behaviours and not merely different speeds. And **the `DET` position is itself a claim
that needs evidence**: a fixture asserts canonical positive NaN propagation from every
NaN-producing instruction family in the manifest, and the relaxed family's fixtures assert the
fixed arm rather than any arm.

### The intended allocation

WA-0 fixes this table; later milestones may extend it but may not silently widen it.

| Manifest | Admits | Earliest milestone |
|---|---|---|
| `broiler.webassembly.slice` | One type, one function, one export, integer arithmetic, `local.get`/`local.set`, `block`/`loop`/`br`/`br_if`/`return`, `unreachable`. No memory, no table, no global, no import, no float. **Deliberately not a module anyone would ship** — its purpose is to close the whole contract loop against a surface small enough to hold in the head. | WA-1 |
| `broiler.webassembly.core1` | The original standardised surface: the full numeric instruction set including floats, structured control flow, `call` and `call_indirect`, one linear memory with its loads and stores and `memory.grow`, one table, globals, imports and exports of all four kinds, the start function, element and data segments, and custom sections ignored correctly. | WA-6 opens it; WA-7 completes it with imports |
| `broiler.webassembly.core2` | The second standardised group **minus vectors**: sign-extension operators, non-trapping float-to-integer conversion, multi-value blocks and results, reference types with `funcref` and `externref`, bulk memory and table instructions, and the data count section. | WA-8 |
| `broiler.webassembly.vector` | The 128-bit vector instruction family. Its own manifest because it is, by instruction count, comparable to everything above it combined, and because an execution-only image that never needs it should be able to decline it truthfully. | WA-8, or excluded with a published failure |
| `broiler.webassembly.relaxed` | The relaxed vector instructions, under `DET` and only under `DET`. | After `…vector`; excluded by name until it has a run |
| `broiler.webassembly.tailcall` | `return_call` and `return_call_indirect`, and the frame-reuse obligation that makes them meaningful rather than merely accepted. | Increment |
| `broiler.webassembly.exceptions` | Tags, `throw`, the try/catch forms, and `exnref`, together with the unwinding interaction with host frames that [section 12](#12-traps-exhaustion-and-why-neither-is-a-process-failure) fixes. | Increment |
| `broiler.webassembly.gc` | Typed references, subtyping, recursive type groups, structural type canonicalization, struct and array types, and the reference casts. **The largest single increment in the table**, and the one most likely to be re-scoped once the validator meets it. | Increment |
| `broiler.webassembly.memory64` | 64-bit address types for memories and tables. | Increment |
| `broiler.webassembly.multimemory` | More than one memory per module. | Increment |
| `broiler.webassembly.threads` | Shared memories and the atomic instruction family. **Excluded by name, and this exclusion is different from the others**: the core's thread-affinity enforcement reaches a profile only where the core can see a thread, and a profile that starts its own threads is invisible to it. [Section 14](#14-suspension-threads-and-what-this-profile-does-not-declare) records what would have to be true first. | Not allocated |

**Nothing in this table is a schedule.** Its purpose is to fix the granularity at which the surface
may grow, so that the answer to "does this engine support WebAssembly?" is always a manifest set
with runs behind it rather than a version number.

---

## 7. The artifact, the decoder, and one disagreement with the core

### The artifact is a WebAssembly module, unwrapped

Format version 1 admits **a bare WebAssembly binary module as the entire payload**. No Broiler
magic, no Broiler framing, no outer envelope, no re-encoding. The identity the core needs travels
in the artifact descriptor beside the bytes, which
[section 3](#3-what-the-core-already-gives-this-profile-and-what-it-refuses) records as a property
of the shipped contract rather than a hope.

This is worth defending, because the alternative is tempting and wrong. A Broiler wrapper would
make the corpus easier to version and would let the format version carry the manifest. It would
also mean that no artifact any external toolchain produces could be verified without a
transformation step, that a browser would re-encode every module it fetched on its critical path,
and that this component's malformed corpus would be testing a Broiler framing layer rather than
the specification's own binary format. The suite's malformed cases are cases about *this* format;
wrapping it would put a layer between the corpus and the thing the corpus is about.

**What the format version means, then, is the shape of the payload and nothing else.** It is
version 1 for a bare module. It moves if the specification's own binary version field ever moves,
or if a later format version admits a different payload shape —
[section 11](#11-the-store-instances-and-linking) names one candidate. It does **not** move when
the language surface grows, because the feature manifest carries that, and a format version that
tracked specification versions would be a second, redundant, and inevitably disagreeing version
axis.

### The disagreement: canonical against padded variable-length integers

**The core's variable-length integer readers accept canonical encodings only. The specification
requires padded encodings to be accepted. These cannot both be satisfied by the same call.**

The core's position is explicit in two places that ship. Its published support table describes the
binary package as providing "canonical LEB128". Its reader's own source says that over-long
encodings "are rejected rather than accepted and truncated", and gives the reason: "Two encodings
of one value would make a byte-identical artifact check meaningless and would let a payload carry
a value past a length check that read it differently, so the canonical form is the only accepted
form." For a format the core also defines, that reasoning is correct.

The specification's position is equally explicit and goes the other way. Its integer grammar
permits an encoding to use up to a byte count derived from the width, with redundant continuation
bytes inside that budget; its own note is that *trailing zeros are still allowed*, and it gives an
8-bit example in which two distinct byte sequences both encode the same value. What is rejected is
exceeding the byte budget, and setting unused bits in the terminal byte. The suite has a file
devoted to exactly this, containing modules with padded encodings that must be **accepted** beside
modules with over-long ones that must be rejected as malformed — and production toolchains emit
padded immediates routinely, because emitting a fixed-width placeholder and patching it later is
how a single-pass code emitter works.

So a WebAssembly verifier built on `TryReadVarUInt32` would reject modules that clang produces.
That is not a tuning question; it is a wrong answer to a conformance test with a real-world
consumer behind it.

**The resolution, and it is taken here rather than deferred.** This profile decodes its own
variable-length integers, over the core's byte-level primitives, inside its own decoder. It calls
the core's `TryReadByte`, `TryReadBytes`, `TryReadUInt32LittleEndian` and its 64-bit counterpart —
which are the right members for the module's own version field and for float immediates —
`TryEnterSection`, `TryExitSection`, `TrySkipSectionBody`, and `TryChargeWork`, and it calls the
core's bounded allocator; it does **not** call the core's
`TryReadVarUInt32` or `TryReadVarUInt64`, and consequently it does not call `TryReadDeclaredCount`
either, because that member reads a canonical integer before comparing it against its bound.

Three obligations follow, and each is a WA-2 gate clause rather than a note:

1. **The bound-before-use ordering is re-derived, not inherited.** `TryReadDeclaredCount` exists so
   that a caller "cannot loop, size a buffer, or reserve capacity from a number that never passed
   its bound". This profile's own count reader must have exactly that property, and it must be
   asserted mechanically for every corpus entry including every failing one — not tested once.
   Losing this by re-implementing it is the single most likely way for this decision to go wrong,
   which is why it is written down beside the decision rather than after it.
2. **Signed integers are this profile's anyway.** The core has no signed variable-length reader at
   all, and the format needs three widths of them, including the 33-bit form block types use. So
   part of this code was always going to be written here; the decision above extends it rather
   than starting it.
3. **The deviation is recorded as a deviation, and it moves a budget dimension.** This component
   does not get to describe itself as using the core's variable-length readers, and its support
   table says which core primitives it uses and which it replaces. A component that quietly
   re-implements a core primitive and says nothing has created a second implementation of a
   security-relevant check, which is the same shape of defect as a second verifier. **The support
   table must also say which dimensions change side.** The core's own metering split is stated in
   three rows — unevadable, core-metered *when the profile routes through the binary package which
   it is obliged to route through*, and profile-charged obligation — and declining the guarded count
   reader moves `DeclaredCount` out of the second row into the third for this profile. `SectionCount`
   and `StructuralDepth` stay core-metered, because this profile still enters and exits sections
   through the core; `ArtifactBytes` stays unevadable, because the reader's own construction
   enforces it whatever the caller does. So exactly one dimension migrates, this profile names it,
   and the core's obligation row is made conditional rather than absolute — because as written it is
   already false for the first product profile that will exist.

[Section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) carries the amendment
candidate this produces — a padding-tolerant reader in the core's binary package, parameterized by
a byte budget — and states its counterweight honestly: it is general to any format that inherits
this encoding, and it is *not* something the core needs for itself. That is what makes it a
proposal from a profile rather than a core defect.

### The second disagreement is smaller and entirely this profile's problem

**Section identifiers do not sort into section order.** The specification says so in its own words
— "section ids do not always correspond to the order of sections in the encoding of a module" —
and there are two live examples: the tag section carries a higher identifier than the data count
section and is ordered before it, and the data count section is ordered before the code section
whose indices it exists to bound.

A decoder that validates section order by comparing identifiers is therefore wrong, and wrong in a
way that a smoke test over a toolchain-produced module will not catch, because the common case
happens to be ordered. The order is a table, the table is derived from the pinned specification
revision, and a corpus entry exists for every adjacent pair the table forbids.

### What the decoder must reject, before any validation begins

- a payload whose magic or version field is not the specification's;
- malformed framing, truncation, and a section whose declared size does not match its content;
- an integer exceeding its byte budget, and an integer whose terminal byte sets unused bits —
  distinguished from each other, because the suite distinguishes them;
- a non-custom section appearing twice, or out of the specified order;
- a vector length that would exceed the effective declared-count ceiling, refused **before** it is
  used to loop or to size anything;
- a name that is not well-formed UTF-8, checked as the specification defines it rather than as the
  platform's decoder happens to behave;
- a data count section that disagrees with the data section, and a code section using a data index
  when no data count section is present;
- structural depth beyond the effective ceiling, and artifact bytes beyond it; and
- anything the pinned specification calls malformed, with this profile's own diagnostic code and a
  byte position.

**Those bullets do not all produce the same outcome category, and an earlier draft of this
paragraph said they did.** Six of them are `InvalidArtifact` with a decode reason, a diagnostic
code, and a byte position. Two are not: **a vector length beyond the effective declared-count
ceiling, and artifact bytes beyond theirs, are `ResourceExhaustion` naming one dimension and one
scope** — the module is well formed and this image declined to admit it, which is the same rule
[section 8](#8-validation) applies to every other implementation limit and the same one the core
rules for the whole bounded-read status set. The distinction is not cosmetic here: every corpus
entry pins its observed ⟨outcome, reason, diagnostic code⟩ triple and replays it across three
publish modes, so an entry recorded under the wrong category **passes** and encodes the wrong
answer, and the published mapping table would be built wrong from the start. The mapping is a
published table bound in both directions, with no invented reason and no aliasing, and it names
the category per bullet.

### Three disciplines that make the list provable rather than aspirational

1. **A retained malformed corpus.** Every entry carries its bytes, its hash, and its expected
   outcome, reason, and diagnostic code, and every entry is replayed under JIT, trimmed, and
   Native AOT with the three tables compared byte for byte. The corpus grows at every milestone
   that grows the accepted surface, and it contains **control entries that verify successfully** —
   including a padded-integer entry that must be *accepted*, because a corpus in which nothing
   passes would not notice a decoder that rejects everything, and a corpus with no padded
   acceptance would not notice a regression back onto the core's canonical reader.
2. **Coverage-guided fuzzing over two surfaces**, kept apart because they fail differently: the
   decoder and validator over arbitrary bytes, and the interpreter over
   validated-but-adversarial modules. Every session retains its seed, its iteration budget, its
   runtime settings, and every minimized counterexample. **A counterexample is closed by a named
   regression, never by an allow-list entry.**
3. **Ordering assertions.** The effective ceilings are materialized before the first byte is read;
   a refusal happens before the allocation it would have authorised; a declared count is compared
   against its bound before it sizes anything or bounds a loop. These are asserted mechanically for
   every corpus entry including every failing one, because the ordering is the property and the
   answer alone does not show it.

## 8. Validation

### One verification, two phases, and the order is observable

The specification is a three-phase language — decode, validate, instantiate — and this component
maps the first two onto the core's single verification and the third onto instantiation. The
mapping is not a convenience: it is what the core's contract requires, because a verified handle
means the artifact is admitted and the stage matrix makes `InvalidArtifact` illegal at every later
stage.

Within that one verification, **decoding completes before validation begins**, and the ordering is
observable rather than internal. A module that is both malformed and invalid must be reported
malformed; the suite asserts it; and an implementation that fused the phases to save a pass would
report the wrong one. This is stated as invariant 4 because it is the kind of property that a
performance-minded rewrite silently destroys.

### The lazy-validation permission is declined, and that is cheaper as well as stricter

The specification's implementation-limitations appendix permits an implementation to defer a
function body's validation until its first invocation, with an invalid body then trapping, subject
to the body being fully validated before its execution begins. Engines take that permission for
start-up latency.

This profile does not, for three independent reasons and one bonus:

- **Invariant 3 forbids it.** A structural or type check that happens at first execution is a check
  reported as a trap, and a trap and a rejection are different answers to different questions.
- **The core forbids it.** `InvalidArtifact` is not a legal outcome at instantiation, invocation, or
  resume, and the core's own note explains why: a verified handle cannot later become invalid
  without creating a second verification point.
- **The core's verification is whole-artifact and eager anyway**, so nothing would be saved on the
  path that matters.
- **And it is easier.** Under eager validation, an `assert_invalid` case is a rejection at
  verification, full stop. Under lazy validation it is a rejection only if the offending function
  is reached, which turns a large family of conformance assertions into a question about
  reachability.

What is genuinely lost is start-up latency on a large module with a cold entry point.
[Section 18](#18-persistence-and-the-code-cache) records the measurement that would reopen it, and
[section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) records that reopening it
is an amendment to the *core*, not a local decision, and that this profile would have to fund the
amendment with a number rather than an intuition.

### The algorithm is the specification's, and its shape matters

Validation of function bodies is the specification's own single-pass algorithm over three stacks —
a value-type stack, a control-frame stack, and an initialization stack — with each control frame
carrying its opcode, its start and end types, the value and initialization heights it was entered
at, and an unreachable flag.

Two properties of that algorithm are load-bearing here rather than incidental:

- **Unreachable code is type-checked polymorphically, not skipped.** After an unconditional branch
  the frame is marked unreachable and the value stack is truncated to the frame's height; popping
  from an unreachable frame at its own height yields a bottom type that satisfies any constraint.
  This is what lets dead code contain instructions with no valid operand and still validate, and
  it is a place implementations get quietly wrong in both directions — accepting genuinely invalid
  dead code, or rejecting valid dead code. The suite tests both directions extensively.
- **It is a single linear pass and it composes with decoding.** The algorithm is designed to run
  inside a decoder, which is what makes "decode then validate" implementable without materialising
  an intermediate tree per function. This component may fuse them *within one function body* as an
  implementation choice, provided the phase-order property above survives at module granularity —
  and WA-3 states which it did, because the two readings differ in what a partially decoded module
  reports.

### The implementation-limitations appendix is where the core's dimensions get their referents

The specification does not fix concrete limits; it enumerates the places an implementation may
impose one and says that exceeding them may be rejected with an implementation-specific error.
That enumeration maps almost row for row onto the core's budget dimensions, which is the clearest
evidence available that the core's fifteen dimensions were not invented for one language:

| Specification permits a limit on | This profile enforces it as |
|---|---|
| Number of types, functions, tables, memories, globals, tags, imports, exports, element and data segments, struct fields, parameters and results, locals | `DeclaredCount`, against the effective ceiling, before the count is used |
| Nesting depth of control instructions | `StructuralDepth`, subject to the WA-1 decision in [section 3](#3-what-the-core-already-gives-this-profile-and-what-it-refuses) |
| Module size, section size, function body size | `ArtifactBytes` and the section framing |
| Number of sections | `SectionCount` |
| Instructions in a function, instructions in a constant expression, `br_table` label count, `array.new_fixed` length | `DeclaredCount` and `VerifierWork` |
| Subtyping depth and recursive-type group size | `StructuralDepth` and `DeclaredCount`, at the manifest that admits them |
| Name length and character ranges | `DeclaredCount` and the UTF-8 rule |
| Allocated instances, instance sizes, stack frames, labels, values | `LiveBytes` and `CallDepth`, at execution |

Two things follow that a support table must say. **Every one of these limits makes this profile
reject a module the specification calls valid**, which is a legitimate and specification-sanctioned
outcome — and it is still a rejection, so it is `ResourceExhaustion` naming a dimension and a
scope, never `InvalidArtifact`. Confusing the two would tell a caller that its module is malformed
when the truth is that this host declined to spend the memory. And **the defaults are policy, not
correctness**: they are recorded, they are a host's to tighten, and the conformance run publishes
the effective vector it ran under, because a suite result obtained under generous ceilings does not
transfer to a product that ships tight ones.

### The diagnostic registry

Every rejection carries a stable code from a published, versioned registry, bound in **both**
directions: every code the profile can emit appears in the registry, and every code in the registry
is reachable from a named case. Each code maps onto exactly one core reason. Positions are byte
offsets into the payload, with a documented encoding, and they are stable across a rebuild.

**The registry has two carriers and the sentence above spans both, which is worth saying because the
core's do not.** A verification rejection travels as the core's own pair — this profile's stable
32-bit diagnostic code plus an opaque position record — on the verifier outcome. A trap, an uncaught
exception, or a link error is a `ProfileFault`, and the core's only channel for its detail is the
typed payload: the diagnostics record has nowhere to put it and the position field is populated on
the verification path alone. So a trap's position and code travel **in the payload**, not in the
core's diagnostics, and the registry says which carrier each code uses. Getting this wrong surfaces
as a design argument at WA-5 and WA-6, when the payload turns out to need a field the registry
assumed the core would carry.

**Positions travel in the core's position record**, which carries a section index, a byte offset,
and two profile-owned coordinates the core does not interpret. WA-3 states which of the four this
profile populates, what it puts in the two coordinates — the natural candidates are the section
identifier and the function index — and what a section index of `-1` means here. That sentence
exists because two profiles designing two position encodings against one shared record, neither
naming it, is how two incompatible conventions get built against one struct.

The registry is published at WA-3 and versioned from then on, because a diagnostic code that
changes meaning between releases silently invalidates every retained corpus entry that recorded it.
**The registry revision is therefore recorded with every retained corpus entry**, so an entry's code
can be dated; the core carries a revision for its own reason registry and none for a profile's, so
WA-3 states which field this profile uses for it or names it as an amendment candidate.

---

## 9. The value, store, and frame model

**This decision is taken before the interpreter is written, and it is a gate on entry to WA-5
rather than that milestone's first task.**

Unlike a language whose library is already typed against an existing value base type, this
profile's value set is closed, small, and fully specified, which makes the decision tractable — but
also makes an unrecorded answer inexcusable, because there is no legacy to blame it on.

What the decision must state, in both directions — what it buys and what it costs:

| Row | What must be decided and recorded |
|---|---|
| Numeric representation | How `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, and `f64` are held. The specification's own value set is untyped at run time within a validated module, because validation has already proved the types — so a single 64-bit slot is expressible and an eight-byte tagged form is not required. Whether the operand stack is typed, untyped, or split is the decision. |
| Vector representation | How `v128` is held once the vector manifest opens, and whether admitting it changes the slot width for every other value. A representation that is chosen for scalars and then widened for vectors is a rewrite; one that reserves width it does not use is a permanent cost. **This row is decided at WA-5 even though vectors arrive much later**, because it is the only row whose late answer invalidates the early ones. |
| Reference representation | How `funcref`, `externref`, and later the garbage-collected reference types are held, rooted, and kept distinct from numeric slots. An external reference is host-owned and crosses the core boundary as an opaque reference; [section 13](#13-memories-tables-globals-and-the-host-boundary) fixes its lifetime. |
| Rooting and lifetime | Rooting for operand slots, locals, globals, table elements, and host references, and who owns each. |
| Call convention | How arguments and results are passed for a direct call, an indirect call, a host call, and a tail call, including how the frame-reuse obligation of a tail call is expressed before the tail-call manifest exists. |
| Frames and labels | Frame ownership, label representation for structured control flow, the native cost of one interpreter frame, and how that cost fixes the `CallDepth` default. |
| Trap propagation | How a trap leaves an instruction, unwinds frames, and becomes a payload, expressed explicitly rather than as an exception the dispatch loop happens to catch. [Section 12](#12-traps-exhaustion-and-why-neither-is-a-process-failure) is the whole treatment. |
| Metering | Where every `Poll()` and every charge sits in the loop, and against which dimension. A representation that makes charging awkward is a representation with a hidden cost. |

Each row carries correctness fixtures and Native AOT representation probes retained beside it. **A
representation is not accepted because it looks compact**, and it is not accepted on a JIT
measurement alone.

### `CallDepth` is measured, not chosen

A recursing module must be refused as `ResourceExhaustion` naming `CallDepth`, on every claimed
RID, under Native AOT — **rather than terminating the process**. A stack overflow is not
translatable into a result, so claiming to handle deep recursion without a measured bound would be
an untruthful capability claim.

This profile has an unusually direct check on that claim: the conformance suite asserts it. Its
exhaustion assertions exist precisely to require that an engine survives runaway recursion and
reports it, and they are scored like every other assertion family. So the `CallDepth` default is
derived from a retained, reproducible measurement of native frame cost per interpreter frame on
each claimed RID, and the suite's own exhaustion cases are the proof on each.

The same discipline fixes `MaxUnchargedWork`, `ChargingGranularity`, and `CancellationPollBound`:
each is a number chosen from a measurement and recorded with it, not a round figure.

### Proportional charging

This is the core's obligation **CO-1** in ADR 0007, cited rather than re-derived: the rule that
work be charged as a monotone non-decreasing function of the input, at least the ceiling of that
function over the declared granularity, in the profile's own work units and never in measured time,
is the core's and not this profile's invention. What this profile owns is the family list, the
functions, and the fixtures.

For every operation whose cost grows with its input, this profile declares a monotone
non-decreasing charging function and a granularity, and charges at least the ceiling of that
function over the granularity. Each family gets a retained fixture with an unsimplified control.

The families, named now because each is a **single instruction** and therefore the easiest possible
place for a flat charge to hide:

- `memory.copy`, `memory.fill`, `memory.init`, and `data.drop`;
- `table.copy`, `table.fill`, `table.init`, `table.grow`, and `elem.drop`;
- `memory.grow`, which charges allocation as well as work;
- `array.new`, `array.new_default`, `array.new_data`, `array.new_elem`, `array.copy`, `array.fill`,
  and `array.init_data`, when the garbage-collected manifest opens;
- `br_table`, whose label vector is guest-controlled at validation time; and
- the segment-initialisation work instantiation performs before any guest instruction runs, which
  is charged to the instantiating operation and is the one member of this list that is not an
  instruction at all.

**An operation family without a proportionality fixture does not ship in the increment**, and
`memory.fill` over a large memory is the canonical negative control: a flat charge passes a
functional test and fails this one.

## 10. Execution: mapping WebAssembly onto the core lifecycle

The core's lifecycle is fixed and this profile refines observable behaviour inside it. The mapping:

| Core stage | What this profile does |
|---|---|
| Catalog build | Supplies one descriptor through one static accessor. No aggregate listing type exists anywhere in the graph. |
| Runtime creation | The composition supplies ceilings, capabilities, and the external-suspension mode. The executor factory creates one executor per runtime from the execution environment. |
| Verification | Decodes and validates into an immutable `IVmVerifiedState` — the module, its types, its function bodies, its segments, and the ceilings computed for it. Owns or fully decodes its input: later mutation, disposal, or concurrent overwrite of the caller's buffer changes nothing. |
| Instantiation | **Links and allocates.** Resolves imports against the host and the store, allocates memories, tables, globals, and tags, initialises element and data segments, and runs the start function. Returns `Instantiated`, or `Faulted` carrying a link error or a start-function trap. |
| Invocation | Calls an exported function. Runs to `Completed` with a typed payload carrying the returned values, or `Faulted` with a typed trap or uncaught exception. |
| Resume | Not reached at any manifest this roadmap allocates. Implemented as the named invalid-state refusal, and [section 14](#14-suspension-threads-and-what-this-profile-does-not-declare) records why the type is implemented anyway. |
| Unwind | Terminal. Releases memories, tables, and host references under the tighter of the abandon budget and the unwind budget, and **runs no guest code**. [Section 14](#14-suspension-threads-and-what-this-profile-does-not-declare) records that this is simpler here than it would be for a language with user-visible finalisation, and that the simplicity is a property of the manifest set rather than a permanent one. |
| Disposal | Drains an in-flight step before releasing the artifact lease under it. This profile's obligation is that a step is interruptible often enough for the drain to succeed, which is what the cancellation poll bound is for. |

### The four failure phases, and why they land in three different places

The specification's failure taxonomy is finer than the core's stage boundaries, and the suite tests
each kind separately. Getting this table wrong is the most likely way to produce an engine that
passes functionally and fails conformance:

| Specification failure | Suite assertion | Where this profile answers | Core outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Malformed — the bytes do not decode | `assert_malformed` | Verification, decode phase | `InvalidArtifact`, with a decode reason and a byte position |
| Invalid — it decodes but does not type-check | `assert_invalid` | Verification, validation phase | `InvalidArtifact`, with a validation reason |
| Unlinkable — imports cannot be satisfied | `assert_unlinkable` | **Instantiation** | `ProfileFault` carrying a typed link error. It cannot be `InvalidArtifact`: the stage matrix forbids that outcome at instantiation, and it would be wrong anyway — the module is valid, the *environment* did not supply what it needs |
| Uninstantiable — linking succeeded, the start function trapped | `assert_trap` on an instantiation | Instantiation | `ProfileFault` carrying a typed trap. **No instance is published**, and a test asserts it |
| Trap during a call | `assert_trap` on an action | Invocation | `ProfileFault` carrying a typed trap |
| Uncaught exception reaching the embedder | `assert_exception` | Invocation | `ProfileFault` carrying a typed uncaught-exception payload, distinguishable from a trap, once the exceptions manifest opens |
| Resource exhaustion, including call-stack exhaustion | `assert_exhaustion` | Instantiation or invocation | `ResourceExhaustion` naming one dimension and one scope — **not** a profile fault, and not a trap |

Two consequences of the core's result vocabulary that this profile must live inside:

**A trap is not a core category.** It is a typed payload behind `ProfileFault`. The core's
categories describe what happened to the *operation*, not what the module computed, and this
profile adds no case to them.

**A host exception is a host failure, unless it is cancellation or exhaustion.** The core's
translation precedence applies, and it is **ADR 0011**'s rules X1/X2/X3 — ordered and exhaustive,
evaluated in order, stopped at the first match. Cited by that identifier rather than restated,
because the core has already recorded that two profile roadmaps restating this rule from the
implementation instead of citing the record is a discoverability defect. The rule: a cancellation
exception carrying the operation's own token is
cancellation; an exhausted meter at the moment of the catch is resource exhaustion; anything else
is a host failure naming the capability. The handler matrix is tested in both directions across
the boundary, and once the exceptions manifest opens, a host failure crossing WebAssembly frames
must not be catchable by a WebAssembly `catch_all` — because a host failure is not a WebAssembly
exception and making it catchable would let guest code swallow a capability fault.

### The entry-point problem, which for this profile is the central one

An invocation request carries one UTF-8 entry-point name and nothing else. There is no argument
channel. The result channel exists and is adequate: a typed profile payload carries returned
values, several of them, so multi-value returns are expressible today.

**For this profile the asymmetry is not an inconvenience; it is the gap between "runs modules" and
"runs modules anyone can use."** A WebAssembly module has no notion of a program to run. It exports
functions with typed signatures, and calling one with arguments is the entire interface. The
conformance suite is built on it end to end: its actions invoke an export by name with a list of
typed constants and compare typed results.

Three answers exist, and **WA-1 picks one and records it with its consequences**:

1. **Encode arguments into the entry-point text.** The entry point is UTF-8 bytes this profile
   interprets, and the core carries them verbatim without decoding, re-encoding, or trimming them
   — a property its own contract asserts. So this profile may define an entry-point encoding: a
   name alone, or a name followed by a typed argument list in a specified textual form. This works
   today, needs no amendment, is fully testable, and is honestly ugly. Its real costs are that
   floating-point arguments must round-trip exactly through text, that a byte-array argument would
   be absurd, and that every embedder must implement the encoder.
2. **Invert the direction with a host capability.** The module imports a host function that returns
   its arguments; the entry point is a wrapper the embedder supplies. This keeps the invocation
   surface clean and moves the problem into the capability channel, which carries a span of 64-bit
   integers and one 64-bit result. It works for the numeric types, does not work for references,
   and requires the *module* to cooperate — which the conformance suite's modules will not.
3. **Propose an amendment.** A typed argument vector on the invocation request.

**The recommendation this roadmap carries into WA-1 is (1), with (3) opened against measured
evidence rather than distaste.** The reason is that (1) is sufficient for the conformance harness,
which is the consumer that must exist first, and it is available now against a contract that is
frozen. [Section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) states the
amendment's counterweight, and it is the strongest in this document: **this profile is the
counterweight the core designed the contract against, and it is the profile that needs an argument
channel most.** A gap that binds the language with no parser, no text format, and no dynamic loads
is not one language's need in disguise.

### One further consequence, stated because it is easy to miss

The entry-point name is UTF-8 bytes, and a WebAssembly export name is an arbitrary well-formed
UTF-8 name — which may contain any character, including the ones any encoding scheme in answer (1)
would want to use as separators. The encoding must therefore be unambiguous over the full name
space rather than over the names that happen to appear in test modules, and a corpus entry exists
for an export whose name contains the separator. An encoding that works until someone exports a
function named `f(i32)` is a defect with a schedule attached.

---

## 11. The store, instances, and linking

This is the section where the core contract and WebAssembly semantics meet most sharply, so it
states the problem exactly before it states any answer.

### The problem

WebAssembly's third phase allocates a module instance **into a store**, and a store holds every
instance, memory, table, global, and tag in an embedding. Instances in one store can import each
other's exports; instances in different stores cannot see each other at all. That is not an
optimisation, it is the specification's own structure, and the conformance suite depends on it:
its scripts register an instance under a name and then instantiate further modules that import
from it, and a whole file of the suite is devoted to linking.

The core offers exactly one instantiation shape. `Instantiate` takes a verified artifact and
returns a fresh `IVmInstanceState`; there is no overload that instantiates into an existing one,
and there is no path from an executing profile to a nested core instantiation. Confirmed against
the shipped runtime rather than inferred: the two `Instantiate` overloads differ only in whether
limit overrides are supplied.

So a design must say where the store lives, and **there are exactly three places it can live.**

### The three readings

| Reading | The store is | What an artifact is | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — one instance, one store** | Whatever one `IVmInstanceState` holds | One module, bare | Simplest and wrong for anything real. Two modules can never link, the suite's linking files cannot run at all, and the profile could never host a toolchain that emits more than one module. It is recorded here only to be rejected explicitly, because it is what an implementer arrives at by default. |
| **B — one artifact, one link set** | Whatever one `IVmInstanceState` holds, but an artifact carries several modules | A container: N modules plus a link plan | Entirely within contract, verified as one unit, and deterministic — the handle means *this whole set links*. But it needs a second format version and a Broiler-invented container, which is the thing [section 7](#7-the-artifact-the-decoder-and-one-disagreement-with-the-core) argued against; and a browser that instantiates modules as it fetches them cannot use it. |
| **C — one runtime, one store** | Executor-scoped: the executor is created once per runtime and holds the store; each `IVmInstanceState` is one module instance's handle into it | One module, bare | Semantically the specification's own shape, keeps bare payloads, and supports incremental instantiation. But the store now outlives every individual instance, disposal order becomes a real design problem, and **there is no contract channel that names an instance for a later module to import from.** |

### What this roadmap fixes now, and what WA-5 decides

**Reading A is rejected here.** No milestone may deliver it, because a profile that cannot link
cannot run the suite and cannot host a real toolchain, and discovering that at WA-5 would mean
rewriting the store.

**WA-5 chooses between B and C, as a numbered decision with its consequence stated in both
directions**, and it chooses before the linker is written rather than during it. The inputs are
recorded now so the decision is not taken on taste:

- **The naming channel is the crux of C.** An import names a module and a field; something must
  map that module name onto an instance. The contract offers no member for it. Three candidates
  exist and each has a defect worth stating: the artifact descriptor's caller identity is a string
  the caller supplies and the verifier can read, but the core documents it as a diagnostic field
  that is "never parsed", and building semantics on a field the core may tighten is a defect with
  a schedule; a custom section in the module could carry a registration name, but that is a
  Broiler extension inside a standard format and any module carrying it becomes non-portable in
  one direction; and the entry-point channel of
  [section 10](#10-execution-mapping-webassembly-onto-the-core-lifecycle) could carry a
  registration command, which folds this problem into the one WA-1 is already solving. **The third
  is the least bad and is the one WA-5 should cost first**, precisely because it reuses a channel
  this profile must build anyway.
- **B's container is not as offensive as it first looks.** Format version 1 stays a bare module,
  format version 2 adds the container, and the two coexist under one descriptor's version range.
  A browser uses version 1 and reading C's incremental path; a toolchain shipping a linked set of
  modules uses version 2. **The readings are not exclusive**, and the honest possibility that WA-5
  should evaluate is that this profile wants both: C for the store's shape, B for the case where a
  set really is one deployable unit.
- **The suite forces the issue and dates it.** WA-4 stands the harness up and WA-5 is the first
  milestone that can score a linking file. A decision deferred past WA-5 is a decision the
  conformance run makes by failing.

### What is fixed regardless of the reading

- **A memory, table, global, or tag is owned by the store, not by the instance that declared it.**
  The specification says so, and it is why an imported memory survives the disposal of the instance
  that exported it. Whichever reading wins, the ownership model is the store's and a test asserts
  that disposing an exporting instance does not invalidate an importing one's view.
- **Linking is refused as a whole or not at all.** A partially linked instance is never published.
  A test asserts that after a refused link there is no instance to find, mirroring the core's own
  no-partial-binding rule for host capabilities.
- **The link failure taxonomy is this profile's and it is published.** Unknown module, unknown
  field, kind mismatch, signature mismatch, limits mismatch on an imported memory or table,
  mutability mismatch on an imported global, and type mismatch on an imported tag are each a named
  diagnostic with its own case, because the suite distinguishes them and a single "unlinkable"
  answer would score identically while telling a developer nothing.
- **Host imports are checked twice, deliberately, and the two checks answer different questions.**
  At verification, the profile reads the registered capability descriptors from the verification
  context and refuses a module naming a host import the composition does not carry — that is
  `InvalidArtifact` with `UnsatisfiedHostAssumption`, and it means *this image can never run this
  module*. At instantiation, the linker resolves the actual bindings — and a failure there means
  *this store does not have it right now*. The first is a property of the image; the second is a
  property of the moment.
- **A shareable handle is only shareable where its assumptions hold.** Because verification
  records the capability assumptions it checked, the core refuses a handle presented to a runtime
  whose capability set differs, with `SharedHandleCapabilityAssumptionMismatch`. For this profile
  that is a feature and a constraint at once: two browser realms with the same imports share one
  verified module; two with different imports do not, however identical the bytes.
  [Section 18](#18-persistence-and-the-code-cache)'s cache key must say so.
- **No byte source but the caller.** This profile declares no guest-initiated loads, and an
  architecture rule asserts the profile assembly reaches no filesystem, socket, embedded resource,
  or byte-returning host object. There is no dynamic module loading instruction in the language and
  there must be none in the implementation.

## 12. Traps, exhaustion, and why neither is a process failure

A trap is the specification's word for an abort that unwinds to the embedder. The list is closed
and every member is reachable from guest input: `unreachable`; integer division by zero; the one
signed-division overflow case; a float-to-integer conversion of a NaN or an out-of-range value;
an out-of-bounds memory access; an out-of-bounds table access; an indirect call through a null
element; an indirect call whose target signature does not match; and, once the relevant manifests
open, a null reference dereference, an out-of-bounds array access, and a failed cast.

Three properties are gates rather than notes:

**A trap is a value, not an exception.** It leaves the interpreter as a typed payload behind
`ProfileFault`, carrying its kind and the position that produced it. Whether the interpreter
*implements* unwinding with a CLR exception is a WA-6 decision with a measurement attached — it is
the single most common place an interpreter pays for a rarely-taken path — but the answer is
invisible at the boundary, and a scan asserts nothing derived from a CLR exception type crosses it.

**Exhaustion is not a trap, and conflating them fails conformance.** The suite has separate
assertion families, and a call-stack overflow is exhaustion. It maps onto `ResourceExhaustion`
naming `CallDepth` and a scope. An engine that reported it as a trap would score wrong on the
family that exists to check exactly this, and would also be telling a host that a module misbehaved
when the truth is that a ceiling bit.

**`memory.grow` and `table.grow` fail by returning, not by trapping.** They answer `-1` when the
allocation is refused. So a refused growth is *guest-observable* and must not become a core
resource-exhaustion outcome — the operation continues, and the module decides what to do. This is
the one place where a budget refusal is correctly invisible to the host, and a test asserts both
halves: that the allowance was not spent, and that the operation completed normally with the
module observing the failure. Getting this wrong in the other direction — turning a refused grow
into an aborted operation — would break a large class of real modules, which allocate
speculatively and handle the refusal.

**And the specification is explicit that growth stays non-deterministic even under `DET`**, in
order to be able to indicate resource exhaustion. So this profile's `DET` claim in
[section 6](#6-feature-manifests-how-the-language-surface-is-admitted) does not extend to memory
growth, and the support table says so rather than implying a determinism it does not have.

---

## 13. Memories, tables, globals, and the host boundary

### Memories

A linear memory is the largest thing this profile allocates and the main reason `LiveBytes` is
declared. Four properties are fixed here:

- **A memory is reported, grown, and released through the meter.** Allocation on instantiation,
  growth on `memory.grow`, release on store disposal. A memory that is allocated without being
  reported is a ceiling that does not exist.
- **Bounds checks are not optional and not deferred.** Every access is checked, and the check is
  where the bulk of the interpreter's per-instruction cost will sit.
  [Section 19](roadmap.gates.md#19-measurement-discipline)'s measurement lane exists partly to
  publish that cost honestly rather than to hide it.
- **The representation decision names its own limits.** Whether a memory is a managed array, a
  pinned buffer, or a reserved virtual range with guard pages is a WA-6 decision with Native AOT
  and per-RID consequences, and a virtual-reservation strategy that works on one platform and not
  another is a claim about RIDs, not about the profile.
- **A successful growth invalidates every view a host holds over that memory.** Growth may
  reallocate, so any span, pointer, or buffer the embedder was handed before it is stale
  afterwards, and the rule is that it is *invalid* rather than merely stale — the embedder
  re-acquires or fails. The JavaScript API models exactly this as detaching the buffer, so a
  representation chosen without the rule is a representation that cannot express the boundary
  [section 17](#17-the-cross-profile-boundary-the-javascript-api-for-webassembly) prices. This is
  stated here rather than in
  [section 17](#17-the-cross-profile-boundary-the-javascript-api-for-webassembly) because it is
  this profile's rule and only its consequence is the embedder's.
- **Shared memories are excluded by name**, with their manifest unallocated.
  [Section 14](#14-suspension-threads-and-what-this-profile-does-not-declare) says why.

### Tables and globals

A table is a vector of references with a declared element type and declared limits; a global is one
value with a mutability flag. Both are store-owned and both may be imported. The interesting cases
are the ones the suite tests and an implementation forgets: an imported table whose declared limits
must be *compatible with* rather than equal to the importer's declaration; an imported global whose
mutability must match exactly; and the segment-initialisation rule below, which is the one an
implementer is most likely to get wrong by reasoning about it.

### Segment initialisation is atomic per segment and not across segments

Both halves are tested by the suite and neither is what a reader guesses.

One segment is bounds-checked before any of it is applied, so **a failing segment writes nothing**.
But segments are applied in order, and a segment already applied **stays applied** when a later one
traps: the suite's linking file asserts that an in-bounds segment is visible after a following
out-of-bounds one has trapped. So "all or nothing" is right at the segment level and wrong at the
module level.

This is spelled out here rather than left to the specification because an implementation that chose
the intuitive whole-module rollback would pass every functional test anyone would write by hand,
and would fail the suite. Both halves get their own case, and the rule is copied from the pinned
revision rather than derived.

It matters most for an **imported** memory or table, because that is where the writes outlive the
failed instantiation: no instance is published, but the memory the segments wrote into belongs to
the store and keeps what it was given.

### External references and the host boundary

**The host boundary is typed, versioned, and refused at binding.** Every import names one exact
capability ID, one exact version, and one signature ID; a mismatch is refused when the runtime is
created, never at first call. Kind, reentrancy, thread affinity, and exception translation are
declared per capability. A failed required import leaves no partially bound runtime. An unbound
optional import has its branch exercised.

The channel itself is narrow and its narrowness shapes the manifests:

- **The value channel carries a span of 64-bit integers in and one 64-bit integer out.** `i32` and
  `i64` fit. `f32` and `f64` fit by exact bit pattern, and a fixture asserts the round trip
  preserves NaN payloads rather than passing through a floating-point register that might quiet
  them — which is the kind of thing that only fails under one RID's calling convention.
- **`v128` does not fit in one slot.** A host import taking or returning a vector needs two, and
  the vector manifest either splits it and documents the encoding or excludes vector-typed host
  imports by name. Splitting is the better answer and it is a decision with a published encoding,
  not an implementation detail.
- **A multi-result host import cannot be expressed at all.** The channel returns one value.
  Multi-value results from *guest* functions are fine — the result payload carries several — but a
  host function returning two values has nowhere to put the second.
  [Section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) carries this as an
  amendment candidate with a strong counterweight, and until then a multi-result host import is a
  named deterministic link failure rather than a silent truncation.
- **An `externref` is a `VmOpaqueRef`.** The core provides one: a runtime-scoped, generation-stamped
  handle with named refusals for a foreign or stale reference. That is the correct shape and this
  profile uses it rather than inventing one. Two obligations follow: an `externref` never leaves
  its runtime, and a table holding external references is reported to the meter as retaining them
  so that a store cannot pin unbounded host state invisibly.
- **A `funcref` crossing to the host has no channel and is excluded** — and the reason is narrower
  than an earlier draft of this bullet gave. It is *not* that no callback direction exists: section
  17 records that cross-runtime reentry is legal and is exactly how a host calls back into a guest.
  The reason is that **the capability channel this profile binds carries values, not callable
  references**, and manufacturing a callable host object out of a store-owned function reference
  would mean this profile publishing a projection whose identity, lifetime, and reentrancy rules it
  would then own on the embedder's behalf. Once the reference-types manifest opens, an exported
  `funcref` is representable inside the store and in a result payload as an opaque profile-owned
  reference, and is not projectable as a callable host object. **Stable identity across the seam —
  the same export handed out twice being recognisably the same thing — is the embedder's rule and is
  written in no document today**; WA-6's export projection records that it does not foreclose one.

No CLR type crosses the boundary in either direction. Arguments and results are the core's transfer
types, and diagnostics carry identity and position without carrying host state.

---

## 14. Suspension, threads, and what this profile does not declare

### It declares no suspension, and that is a statement about the manifests

At every manifest this roadmap allocates, WebAssembly execution runs to completion or to a trap.
There is no `yield`, no `await`, and no instruction that parks a frame. So the descriptor declares
`NotDeclared` for asynchronous instantiation and for external suspension, `Resume` answers the
named invalid-state reason, and `Unwind` releases store resources and runs no guest code.

Three things follow that are worth stating so nobody has to rediscover them:

- **`IVmProfileContinuation` is still implemented.** The core requires the type and the executor
  must answer `Resume` correctly, so the refusals are code and are tested. A profile that declares
  nothing still has to refuse correctly.
- **The frame model is designed to be capturable anyway.** This costs nothing today and is the one
  thing that cannot be retrofitted: a frame model that lives on the CLR stack cannot later be
  moved to the heap without rewriting the interpreter.
  [Section 9](#9-the-value-store-and-frame-model)'s frame row says so, and WA-6's exit gate asks
  for the design rather than the implementation.
- **`Unwind` is simple here, and its simplicity is temporary.** WebAssembly has no user-visible
  finalisation, so terminal unwinding releases memories, tables, and host references and stops. The
  exceptions manifest does not change that — an unwind still runs no guest handler. A future
  stack-switching surface would.

### What would change it

The specification family has a stack-switching direction, and the browser embedding has a
JavaScript promise integration built on it. Either would make a WebAssembly frame parkable and
would make this section's declarations wrong. Neither is in any manifest here, and the roadmap
records the trigger rather than the schedule: **a manifest that admits a parking instruction is a
manifest that requires the suspension design, the routing decision, and the whole of the core's
suspension gate — and it re-opens WA-6's frame model.** That is a milestone-sized change and it is
named so it cannot arrive as an increment.

### Threads are excluded, and this exclusion is different from the others

Shared memories and the atomic instruction family are excluded by name, and the reason is not
scope. It is that the core's thread-affinity enforcement reaches a profile only where the core can
see a thread — its own published support table records affinity as *partial* for exactly this
reason, and says that a profile which starts its own threads is invisible to it.

A shared-memory WebAssembly implementation is a profile whose guest state is reachable from threads
the core did not create. Three things would have to be true before this component could admit it
truthfully, and the roadmap names them rather than leaving "later" to do the work:

1. the store's own concurrency model is designed and tested, including what a `memory.grow` on a
   shared memory does to another thread's view;
2. the metering story is answered, because `IVmMeter` is called from whichever thread is executing
   and the core's affinity rules were not written for a profile with its own; and
3. the core is asked whether a profile-owned thread is admissible at all — which is an amendment
   question, not a local one.

Until then, the support table names the exclusion and its deterministic failure: a module declaring
a shared memory or an atomic instruction is refused at validation, under a manifest that does not
admit it.

---

## 15. The conformance oracle

An engine that grades itself is not evidence. This profile builds the harness before it builds the
interpreter, and the harness's first job is not to score anything — it is to prove that a failing
test comes back as a failure.

This component has one structural advantage over a profile whose surface is a language with no
external suite, and it should be spent deliberately: **the suite grades the verifier before an
interpreter exists.** The malformed and invalid assertion families need no execution at all. So
WA-4 stands the harness up and scores those two families against WA-2's decoder and WA-3's
validator, and the first real conformance number this component publishes is about the boundary
that matters most, at a point where there is nothing to run.

**The method, stated so it can be built from this document.**

- **A pinned suite revision, resolved once.** An immutable commit, resolved before any shard
  starts, cached under a key containing it, and verified by re-reading the checked-out revision. A
  branch name is not a pin.
- **The ingestion path is test-only and is asserted to be.** The suite is distributed as scripts in
  the specification's text format. Reading them means a text-format reader, and that reader is the
  single largest piece of code in this component that must never appear in a product. A scan
  asserts it is absent from every product package and every published closure, and a negative
  control adds a reference to it and observes the scan fail.
- **Script semantics are implemented, not approximated.** The script language has module
  definitions in text and in binary form, registration of an instance under a name, actions that
  invoke an export or read a global, and assertions over each failure family. **Registration and
  the two module forms are not optional extras** — they are what
  [section 11](#11-the-store-instances-and-linking)'s decision has to serve, and a harness that
  skipped them would score a subset while reporting a total.
- **The host module the suite imports is supplied and its shape is recorded.** The suite's modules
  import printing functions, a table, a memory, and globals from a host module the script
  environment is expected to provide. The printing functions are genuine host capabilities; the
  table, memory, and globals are expressible as a WebAssembly module this harness synthesises. WA-4
  records which are which, because a reader needs to know how much of the harness is exercising the
  host boundary and how much is exercising the store. **One trap to check against the pinned
  revision rather than to assume away**: this host module's printing functions have historically
  been overloaded by signature under one name, and a capability table keyed on the import name alone
  would collapse them. WA-4 reads the actual names and signatures off the pin and keys the mapping
  on both, or records that the pin no longer needs it.
- **Content-independent sharding.** A test's shard is a stable hash of its normalized path modulo
  the shard count, so shard membership does not move when the selection changes and a shard's
  history stays comparable.
- **Selection as a recorded pipeline.** Discovery, then known-incorrect exclusion, then manifest
  scope filtering, then per-file selectability. The candidate count and the pre-sharding selected
  count are emitted separately from each shard's executed count, which is what lets the merge prove
  the shards covered the whole selection rather than a subset.
- **Per-assertion-family totals.** Malformed, invalid, unlinkable, uninstantiable, trap, exception,
  exhaustion, and return each report their own selected, executed, passed, failed, skipped, and
  timed-out counts. **A single aggregate percentage is not a result this component publishes**,
  because the families measure different things and an engine can be excellent at one and absent at
  another. A family that selects files and executes none is a named configuration failure, not a
  small total.
- **The self-check runs before every shard.** Deliberately broken fixtures with declared verdicts
  are run against the built profile, **and at least one control fixture that must pass.** A
  mismatch stops the run. A negative control injects a scoring regression, observes the mismatch,
  and reverts.
- **The malformed-before-invalid ordering is checked as its own fixture.** A module that is both
  gets one right answer, and an implementation that fused the phases scores it wrong. This is a
  self-check fixture rather than an ordinary case, because it is a property of the harness's
  interpretation as much as of the engine's.
- **Configuration failures are a closed, named set and each is a failure**: inconsistent shard
  configuration, missing suite revision, empty selection, no executed tests, and a manifest scope
  naming a file the suite does not contain. Removing one shard's report must produce incomplete
  coverage, not a smaller total.
- **The failure manifest is a queue, not an allow-list.** A path leaves it only after a minimal
  repository regression exists, the focused reproduction passes, the affected shard passes, and the
  record is updated. A hand-written entry that a run does not confirm does not survive.
- **The harness has its own regression suite**, run before any shard starts, with the crash
  classifier tested against recorded output. A measurement tool nobody tests is a measurement
  nobody can read.
- **The ratchet.** The first accepted per-family totals for a manifest are the floor. No later run
  of that manifest regresses against them. **The floor records the pinned suite
  revision it was set under.** A suite-revision change re-bases the floor from the first accepted
  run on the new revision, with the old floor and the reason retained; a floor is never compared
  across revisions, because a suite that added tests would otherwise read as a regression and a
  suite that removed them would silently lower the bar. This is the same discipline both the
  diagnostic registry and the corpus already apply to their own pinned revisions.
- **The effective limit vector is published with every run.** A conformance total obtained under
  generous ceilings is not the total a product with tight ones would get, and
  [section 8](#8-validation) makes that a real difference rather than a theoretical one.

Two things this section deliberately refuses. **No total, manifest entry, known-gap entry, or
triage finding from any other component is carried across** — this component starts at zero. And
**a differential against another engine is a cross-check, never the oracle**: two implementations
agreeing on the same wrong answer is still a failure, and another engine's movement may invalidate
an attribution but never accept one.

---

## 16. Deployment compositions, Native AOT, and the browser embedding

**This profile mints exactly one composition label, and the reason is structural rather than
modest.** A composition label describes *when source is compiled*. This profile compiles nothing,
so there is only one answer:

| Label | Contains at run time | What its Native AOT gate proves |
|---|---|---|
| `execution-only` | Decoder, validator, store, linker, interpreter, host adapter | That the accepted manifest set verifies and executes under Native AOT on every claimed RID |

The three-label pattern a language with a compiler needs does not transfer, and inventing a second
label here would be inventing a distinction this component cannot demonstrate. If a future
decision splits the product into more than one assembly —
[section 5](#5-package-boundaries-and-the-dependency-graph) names the vector family and the
garbage-collected surface as the only plausible candidates — that produces further *closures*, not
further composition kinds, and each closure is evidenced on its own.

The gate itself is unchanged from the core's: the composition's closure is read off its own
published output, contains exactly the assemblies its register row declares, and contains no test,
reflection, dynamic-code, or IL-emission assembly. **A linker annotation without execution is
insufficient**, and no publish is evidence for another RID.

### The browser is the smallest closure here, not the largest

For a language whose source arrives as text, a browser composition must link a tokenizer and a
lowering, and its Native AOT gate proves the *larger* closure. For this profile the inverse holds,
and it is the clearest practical benefit of consuming a format rather than a language:

**A browser fetches WebAssembly bytes and hands them to verification.** There is nothing to compile,
no text format on the path, no lowering in the image. The browser composition is the
`execution-only` composition, unmodified. The closure a page exercises is the closure a
precompiled-artifact host exercises, so there is one thing to evidence rather than two, and the
evidence transfers between the two consumers because it is the same image.

**The host keeps its own seam.** An embedder already talks to WebAssembly through its own interface
in terms of bytes, an import object, and an instance. That interface does not change: an adapter
behind it verifies, instantiates, and invokes. The embedder never handles this profile's internal
types, and swapping the engine behind the seam stays a bounded change.

**The division of labour is strict.** The host owns fetch, identity, content policy, integrity
checks, and the event loop; this profile never fetches anything. There is no guest-initiated-load
path to police because the language has no instruction that would use one — which is why
[section 3](#3-what-the-core-already-gives-this-profile-and-what-it-refuses) records the mediator
as absent from this profile's design rather than as refused by its composition.

---

## 17. The cross-profile boundary: the JavaScript API for WebAssembly

This section exists because the component that will consume this profile first is a browser, a
browser reaches WebAssembly through JavaScript, and **nothing in the core makes that free.** No
milestone here delivers it and no manifest admits it. What this section refuses to do is leave it
unpriced.

### What the boundary actually is

`WebAssembly.Module`, `WebAssembly.Instance`, `WebAssembly.Memory`, `WebAssembly.Table`, and
`WebAssembly.Global` are defined by a separate specification, in terms of JavaScript objects, with
a defined coercion between JavaScript values and WebAssembly values in both directions. Implementing
them means two core runtimes, carrying two profiles, exchanging values.

The core's rule for this is explicit and it is a refusal: **share mechanism, never share
semantics.** A shared value representation, frame layout, or opcode set is named in the core's own
table as something it exists not to own. So there is no cross-profile value channel and none is
coming, and a component that wanted one would be asking the core to grow the
lowest-common-denominator model its invariants exist to prevent.

**Two frozen facts settle the route, and neither is obvious from the core's non-goal alone.** The
non-goal excludes "an implied invocation bridge between two profiles", which reads to anyone who
stops there as forbidding the whole thing. It is narrower than that:

- **A guest-initiated load may not name another profile.** The provider must answer with an artifact
  of the profile that asked; a different profile is a provider contract breach, reported as a host
  failure with its own reason. So `WebAssembly.instantiate` called from the other profile is **not**
  a mediated load carrying a different descriptor, it can never become one, and an amendment to the
  mediator is the wrong thing to ask for. This forecloses the design most implementers would try
  first, and it forecloses it by construction rather than by policy.
- **Cross-runtime reentry is legal and depth-bounded.** A host object bridging two independent
  runtimes was admitted deliberately, because forbidding it outright would break exactly this case
  for no safety gain. That is the route: one profile calls out through a host capability, the
  embedder converts, and the other profile's runtime is invoked. **The chain is bounded by aggregate
  call depth, which is only a bound when both runtimes were created under one shared parent** — so a
  two-profile composition root creates one, and a composition that does not has no bound on the
  chain at all.

Both facts are recorded here, and the other intended profile records them too — including the
precondition on the second, which is the half that is easiest to drop. They are written twice on
purpose: the core states them once at its own boundary section, and the first team to build the
seam would otherwise discover the first fact by having a provider refuse them, and the second one
by not having a bound at all.

### The consequence, stated plainly

**The seam is the embedder's, and it is a real cost rather than a formality.** A JavaScript
`WebAssembly.Instance` is a host object owned by the embedder; calling one of its exports is the
embedder receiving a call from the JavaScript profile, converting arguments into this profile's
transfer types, invoking this profile's runtime, and converting results back. Four consequences
follow, and each is a thing a browser team will meet:

1. **Every call crosses the host twice.** A JavaScript-to-WebAssembly call is not a call; it is two
   host-boundary transits and a conversion in each direction. That is the correct price for two
   profiles that share no semantics, and it is a price that shows up in exactly the benchmark
   people run first.
2. **`WebAssembly.Memory` is the hard case, not the function call.** The JavaScript API exposes a
   memory as a byte buffer that JavaScript reads and writes directly and that reflects the guest's
   writes immediately. The core's transfer types are integers, byte spans, and opaque references —
   none of which is a *shared mutable region*. Making a memory visible to a JavaScript profile
   means either the embedder mediating every access, which is unusably slow, or a shared buffer
   both profiles reach, which is shared semantics by another name. **This is the largest unpriced
   risk in this component and it does not belong to this component to solve.** One rule inside it
   *is* this component's and [section 13](#13-memories-tables-globals-and-the-host-boundary) now
   carries it: **a successful `memory.grow` invalidates any view a host holds over that memory**,
   which the JavaScript API models as detaching the buffer. It is stated here because a memory
   representation chosen without it is a representation that cannot express it, and WA-5 takes
   that decision.
3. **Two profiles in one catalog reach each other through their defaults.** A maximum binds only
   the profile an artifact names, so this profile's maxima constrain a JavaScript profile beside it
   not at all. But a host that adopts profile defaults rather than stating ceilings gets the tightest
   in the catalog, so the two components' *default* vectors are coupled whether or not anyone
   intended it, and a stingy default here is felt over there. That is a coordination obligation
   between two independently owned components, smaller than the one this point used to describe -
   a host stating explicit ceilings never meets it - but real. **WA-0 records this profile's defaults
   with that consequence stated**, and the browser composition - wherever it lives - owns the
   reconciliation. Until 2026-08-31 this point said the maxima clamped each other too; that was a
   defect in the core, not a property of the contract, and it has been removed.
4. **The trap-to-exception mapping is the embedder's, and the exception-to-trap mapping is
   worse.** A WebAssembly trap surfacing into JavaScript becomes a JavaScript error object; a
   JavaScript exception thrown from an imported function must unwind WebAssembly frames. This
   profile's half of that is
   [section 12](#12-traps-exhaustion-and-why-neither-is-a-process-failure)'s host-failure rule,
   and the other half is not this profile's at all.

### What this roadmap commits to

- **It commits to owning nothing of it**, and to saying so in the support table rather than letting
  a reader infer that a WebAssembly profile in a browser image implies a working JavaScript API.
- **It commits to not foreclosing it.** Where a design choice inside this profile would make the
  boundary harder — a memory representation that cannot be handed out as a contiguous region, an
  export projection that cannot enumerate, an opaque reference model with no stable identity — the
  choice is recorded with that consequence noted at the milestone that takes it. WA-6's memory
  representation row and WA-7's export projection each carry that clause.
- **It commits to naming the owner.** A browser integration is a consumer of two profile components
  and belongs to whichever component composes them. This roadmap's obligation is to make the price
  visible before that component exists, not to pay it.

---

## 18. Persistence and the code cache

**No milestone here delivers persistence, and the reason is not scheduling.** The core admits a
bounded persisted envelope by contract and implements none, and no core milestone approves one. A
profile-owned cache format written against a core envelope that does not exist would be a second
serialization path with nothing to hold it to the first.

What this roadmap does instead is fix the design so it stays reachable, at no cost today:

- **The cache key is named now, and it is the handle's identity minus the terms that cannot
  survive a process.** Module bytes identity — the artifact content hash, which is the core's own
  key field — the format version, the feature manifest identity and version, **the descriptor
  revision**, the verifier semantic version, the core contract version, **this profile's declared
  hard-maximum vector**, and **the per-import capability tuple for every import the artifact
  binds**. That last term is not optional: [section 11](#11-the-store-instances-and-linking)
  records that the core refuses a shared handle whose capability assumptions differ, so a cache
  that ignored them would produce entries the core then rejects — the good failure, but only
  because the core checks. It is also **seven fields, not two**: capability ID, version, signature
  ID, kind, reentrancy, exception-translation mode, and whether an optional import was bound. The
  last three change the legal control flow at a call site, so a key that omits them collides two
  compiled variants onto one entry, which is a correctness defect in the cache rather than a
  performance one. The tuple covers imports the artifact **binds**; registered-but-unimported
  capabilities are excluded, so an unrelated composition change does not invalidate every entry.
  This profile cites the core's tuple rather than restating it.

  **The *effective* limit vector is deliberately not in the key**, and an earlier draft of this row
  had it. It is part of the handle's in-process identity — which is why two runtimes with different
  ceilings do not share a handle — but it is a timing-dependent, process-local quantity, and
  persisting it would produce a key that never recurs. Correctness does not depend on it, for the
  reason the next bullet already gives: loading always re-validates, and re-validation recomputes
  the vector, so a persisted module never carries a ceiling decision forward. What the key needs is
  the composition-invariant half — **this profile's declared hard maxima**, which is what actually
  varies between two images and does recur.
- **Nothing warmed or process-local is ever serializable.** No object references, no delegates, no
  process-local identities, no warmed caches, no specialized opcodes that have become
  authoritative, no host handles. That is a property of how the verified module is designed, and
  invariant 8's no-mutable-state-reachable-from-a-handle rule — pinned by the handle-immutability
  structural scan in WA-5's exit gate — is what keeps it true before there is a writer to violate
  it.
- **Loading always re-validates.** Outer-envelope compatibility never implies payload compatibility,
  and interpreting old bytes under new semantics is prohibited. A checksum detects corruption; it
  does not authenticate code.
- **The reopening trigger is a measurement, not an argument.** WA-10 measures verification
  throughput per byte and cold-start cost across a range of module sizes. If a host's latency
  budget is missed by a stated margin, the persistence question reopens against that number with
  the core, as a joint gate.

**One neighbouring question is already answered and this profile plans against the answer.** At
core contract version 1 the byte round trip is mandatory. For this profile that costs nothing: the
bytes always came from outside, so there is no in-process producer to bypass serialization for.
This component therefore has no reason to want that amendment, which
[section 20](#20-amendments-and-this-profiles-duty-as-the-counterweight) records — because a
counterweight that stays silent when it agrees is only half a counterweight.

## 20. Amendments, and this profile's duty as the counterweight

The core's amendment procedure exists because a contract frozen before its first profile will meet
something it cannot express. Recording the candidates now is cheap; discovering them during an
implementation is not. Each of these is a **proposal or a refusal**, never a workaround inside the
core's execution loop.

**And this profile carries a second duty that the other does not.** The core's own roadmap names it
the counterweight: the profile with no parser, no text format, and no guest-initiated loads, whose
job is to make the difference visible between a feature that is genuinely general and one language's
need wearing a general shape. A counterweight that only ever asks for things is not one. So the
table below records what this profile **needs**, and the section after it records what this profile
**does not need** — because the second list is the one that makes the first list mean something.

### What this profile would ask for

| Candidate | Why it is needed | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| **An argument channel on invocation** — arguments only, deliberately | An invocation request carries one entry-point name. A WebAssembly module is a set of exported functions with typed signatures and nothing else, and the conformance suite is built end to end on calling them with arguments. [Section 10](#10-execution-mapping-webassembly-onto-the-core-lifecycle)'s answer (1) works and is a text encoding of a typed call. **The scope is arguments and not results**: the typed payload already carries results and several of them, so multi-value returns are expressible today, and filing argument and result as one amendment would put two differently-scoped versions of one capability into the register — which is how a capability gets approved at the wrong width. | **The strongest in this document.** A profile with no parser, no text format, no dynamic loads, and no notion of a program still needs it — which is precisely the test the core wrote this profile in to apply. **The other intended profile now grades the same capability strong**, on the same arguments-only scope, having corrected an earlier draft that graded it weak by reasoning from a browser that compiles a *program* rather than a call — reasoning that stops holding the moment it hosts this profile, since an export call is a typed call whose arguments originate over there. **The two gradings are therefore reconciled and this row is filed rather than blocked**: the core's procedure asks each amendment record to state the other profile's position, and that position is now recorded and agrees. Opened against WA-1's recorded encoding and the cost that encoding actually imposes, not against distaste for it. |
| **A padding-tolerant variable-length integer reader in the core's binary package** | The core's readers accept canonical encodings only; the specification requires padded ones inside a byte budget; production toolchains emit padded immediates. [Section 7](#7-the-artifact-the-decoder-and-one-disagreement-with-the-core) resolves it locally by decoding integers in this profile. | **Moderate, and honestly so.** It is general to any format that inherits this encoding, and there are several. It is *not* something the core needs for its own envelope, and the local resolution works. Opened only if a second profile meets the same wall, which is exactly the extraction gate's own standard. |
| **Multi-result host capabilities** | The capability channel returns one 64-bit value. A WebAssembly host import with two results has nowhere to put the second, so it is a named link failure. | **Moderate.** Any profile whose calling convention admits multiple results meets it. Until then this profile refuses the import deterministically rather than truncating, and the refusal is published. |
| **A wider value slot on the capability channel** | `v128` does not fit in a 64-bit slot. Splitting works and needs a published encoding; a wider slot would not. | **Weak.** This is one type in one instruction family. Recorded so it is not mistaken for the previous row. |
| **A charging hook for work done inside a host capability** | Wall clock covers a slow capability; it does not cover one that allocates on this profile's behalf. | **Strong: general**, and this profile reaches it by the same route any other would. |
| **A persisted envelope** | [Section 18](#18-persistence-and-the-code-cache). | **Strong: general**, and already admitted by contract. It needs a gate rather than an amendment. |
| **A refusable retention member on the metering surface** | [Section 3](#3-what-the-core-already-gives-this-profile-and-what-it-refuses): the retention report returns nothing, so a ceiling-class dimension cannot carry a guest-observable refusal, while [section 12](#12-traps-exhaustion-and-why-neither-is-a-process-failure) requires a refused `memory.grow` to be exactly that. The local resolution an earlier draft recorded — admit growth on a charge, report retention for accounting only — **does not work against the shipped core**: a refused `TryCharge` latches exhaustion and the core rewrites the completed step as `ResourceExhaustion`, so no spelling of a guest-observable refusal exists on the current contract. | **Strong, and blocking.** Any profile with host-visible retained state that the language can ask to grow meets it, which is the counterweight test passing — and unlike every other row in this table there is no local workaround to fall back on. **WA-5 cannot choose a memory representation until this is filed and answered**, so this is the one row this profile opens rather than holds. |

### What this profile does **not** need, and says so

This is the counterweight discharged, and each row is a case where a general-looking requirement is
one language's shape:

| Candidate a language profile might raise | This profile's answer |
|---|---|
| **An in-process producer input form — compiling straight to a verified handle, skipping the byte round trip** | **Not needed, and this profile would not co-sign it.** There is no in-process producer. Every byte arrives from outside the trust boundary, so serialization is not a critical-path cost here — it is the input. A profile that meets this wall meets it because it compiles its own source in-process, which is a property of that profile and not of the contract. |
| **Lazy per-section or per-function verification** | **Not needed, and actively declined.** The specification *offers* this profile the permission and [section 8](#8-validation) refuses it, because a deferred check is a check reported as a trap. If a latency measurement ever justified reopening it, this profile would still want the whole-module answer for the malformed and invalid families, so the amendment would have to preserve exactly what invariant 3 asks for. Recorded as a refusal rather than a silence. |
| **Streaming or incremental verification** | **Wanted eventually, needed by nobody yet.** A browser does stream WebAssembly bytes and would like to validate as they arrive, so this profile is not indifferent — but it has no measurement, and the core already carries a registered amendment shape. Reopened against WA-10's throughput figures, not against the observation that browsers stream. |
| **Nested instantiation through the mediator** | **Not needed.** The language has no dynamic module-loading instruction. [Section 11](#11-the-store-instances-and-linking)'s problem is about *linking*, which happens at instantiation, and none of its three readings requires the core to instantiate anything nested. A profile that needs nested instantiation needs it because its language can ask for code while running, which is the exact property this profile does not have. |
| **A shared cross-profile value channel** | **Refused.** [Section 17](#17-the-cross-profile-boundary-the-javascript-api-for-webassembly) states the cost of not having one and still refuses it, because it is shared semantics and the core's rule against that is right. The price is paid at the embedder's seam, where it is visible. |
| **Asynchronous instantiation** | **Not needed at any allocated manifest.** Instantiation runs a start function that either completes or traps. [Section 14](#14-suspension-threads-and-what-this-profile-does-not-declare) names what would change it and makes that a milestone rather than an increment. |
| **External suspension** | **Not declared.** A debugger for this profile is a separate component, and declaring a capability nothing exercises would make the descriptor claim something the evidence does not show. |

The rule that governs all of it: **a design that can only be hosted by a second core state machine
is refused.** Exactly one core state machine and one core contract version exist in a product graph
at any time.

**Two procedural facts, so the counterweight duty is discharged without overreaching it.** A
refusal in the table above is **recorded, not blocking**. The core's procedure asks whether the
other intended profile could use a capability, is unaffected, or refuses it, and this profile's
answers are the third kind — but a profile with a veto over a core amendment would be a
profile-to-profile dependency established by governance rather than by reference, which is exactly
what the extraction gate's fourth condition exists to prevent. Saying "this profile would not
co-sign it" is a counterweight answer for the record and not a decision. And the procedure is
currently **unexecutable**: no amendment has been minted, and the minting and both co-signing roles
are held by one person, so no co-signature would be independent. Every row here is filed and held
rather than scheduled, and none is admissible until it names a merged or approved capability.
