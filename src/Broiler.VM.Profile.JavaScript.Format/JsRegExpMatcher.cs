/// lowering turns it into a flat array of instructions. Walking the tree would have been less code;
/// what the array buys is the thing this profile cannot do without, which is a machine whose whole
/// state is four integers and three arrays it owns. A tree walk expresses backtracking as a
/// continuation - one CLR frame per pending alternative - and a pattern with a quantifier over a
/// long input then needs a native stack proportional to the INPUT, which is the shape that
/// terminated a process once already and is recorded as JSC-79. The instruction array's backtrack
/// points are entries in an array that grows on the heap, so the deepest pattern over the longest
/// input uses exactly as much CLR stack as the shallowest.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The parser recurses and is bounded for it.</b> Recursive descent over the pattern grammar is
/// the readable form and it is kept, with a nesting counter that refuses past
/// <see cref="MaximumNestingDepth"/> groups deep with a <c>SyntaxError</c>. That is a divergence -
/// the language has no such bound and the comparison engine accepts far deeper - and it is the
/// declared one: a refusal the guest can see, rather than a stack the host cannot recover from. The
/// lowering recurses over the same tree and is bounded by the same counter.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Every instruction dispatched is charged.</b> The machine counts steps and hands them to the
/// caller's meter in blocks; the meter is <c>JsEngine.Charge</c>, which is where a spent allowance
/// becomes an abort and where cancellation is polled. A catastrophically backtracking pattern
/// therefore spends the guest's fuel and ends as a resource exhaustion with a named dimension. Two
/// further ceilings exist for a host that granted an unbounded allowance: the backtrack stack is
/// capped at <see cref="MaximumFrames"/> entries and the undo trail at
/// <see cref="MaximumTrail"/>, and reaching either is reported the same way. Neither is reachable

/// costs, because it is the same work - one read and one class test, with a property-escape class's
/// weight added in <c>TakeSet</c> for both - and not the five steps the loop it replaced
/// dispatched per character, four of which were the loop's own bookkeeping (a split, a counter
/// increment, an empty check and a jump) that a run does not do. So the meter follows what the
